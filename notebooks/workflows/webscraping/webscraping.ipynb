      "1. Rep. Kweisi Mfume, D-Md., on Capitol Hill on March 8, 2023. The lawmaker questioned the effectiveness of the U.S. Postal Service's \"Delivering for America\" reform plan at a hearing on Tuesday.Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images\n",
      "2. Stay Connected\n",
      "3. Sean Michael Newhouse\n",
      "4. As a new leader takes the helm of the U.S. Postal Service, a House panel on Tuesday debated the future of the independent entity. While no member of Congress or expert witness offered a new comprehensive vision, there was near universal consensus on pausing and even reversing the recent reforms of former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy.\n",
      "5. DeJoy’s 10-year plan to promote the financial sustainability of USPS, dubbed Delivering for America, started in 2021 and aimed atslowing some delivery but generate savings. Specifically, it required mail to sit overnight at post offices instead of being collected each evening to be transported to a processing center and sought to consolidate processing plants into 60 regional distribution centers.\n",
      "6. Additionally, stamp prices haveincreased six timessince the start of DeJoy’s tenure and that amount is set to rise again in July to 78 cents. These overhauls, however, did not generate revenue.USPS lost $9.5 billion in fiscal 2024and experienceda net loss of $3.3 billionfor the most recent quarter.\n",
      "7. “Under the Delivering for America plan, our members have suffered unprecedented rate increases and service degradation as the postal service records staggering losses and squanders mailer-funded capital on excess package and processing capacity,” said Mike Plunkett, the CEO and president of the Association for Postal Commerce, which represents businesses that use the mail. “If the incoming PMG is to have any chance at success, the postal service must immediately pause implementation of Delivering for America.”\n",
      "8. Specifically, Plunkett called for a moratorium on rate increases, a pause in spending on building new facilities and halting any product changes while new leadership assesses what reforms to keep, modify or unwind.\n",
      "9. Likewise, Jim Cochrane, the CEO of the Package Shippers Association, a trade organization, testified that USPS needs a “new vision” to improve its finances.\n",
      "10. “The Delivering for America plan has created a widespread degradation of package delivery service performance,” he said. “The changes, unfortunately, disproportionately affect rural communities and those in remote areas of the country.”\n",
      "11. Cochrane touted public-private partnerships, particularly for the “middle mile” when mail is transported between processing facilities.\n",
      "12. Criticizing Delivering for Americahas been a bipartisan trendand that continued Tuesday.\n",
      "13. Paul Steidler of the Lexington Institute and Thomas Schatz of Citizens Against Government Waste, both of which are conservative think tanks, argued for a pause in the overhaul plan. And the top Democrat on the Government Operations Subcommittee alluded to it in his opening remarks.\n",
      "14. “A lot of people have been asking me ‘Why are we paying more money for the same service?’” said ranking member Kweisi Mfume, D-Md. “And some cynically say ‘Why are we paying more money for an even worse service?’”\n",
      "15. The bipartisan USPS board of governors selectedDavid Steiner,a longtime CEO of Waste Management and FedEx board member, to be the next postmaster general. DeJoy in March was pressured to resign due to conflicts with the Department of Government Efficiency,according toThe Washington Post.\n",
      "16. The postal board has been generally supportive of Delivering for America, contending that it is necessary to modernize USPS.\n",
      "17. President Donald Trump,who reportedly backed Steiner, hasmused about privatizing USPSor folding it under the Commerce Department.\n",

      "=== How shrinking the EPA could make wildfire smoke even more dangerous ===\n",
      "1. Smoke from Canadian wildfires drift blankets the city, obscuring the view of the city's skyline on June 5, 2025 in Chicago, Illinois.Scott Olson / Getty Images\n",
      "2. Stay Connected\n",
      "3. Matt Simon and Izzy Ross,Grist\n",
      "4. For weeks, smoke from Canadian wildfires has poured down into the United States, driftingclear across the Atlantic into Europe. Pulmonologist Vivek Balasubramaniam, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, noticed more people calling in with asthma symptoms and asking for advice when smoke doused the region in early June.\n",
      "5. “Walking outside those days, I mean, you could see the brown-orange discoloration to the air,” he said. “When you’re breathing in, you kind of feel like the air is a little heavier, a little harder to do things.”\n",
      "6. Monitoring air quality is key to forecasting and assessing wildfire smoke. Right now, that’s a coordinated effort between federal, state, tribal, and local entities. Federally approved and privately operated monitors feed data into tools like the Environmental Protection Agency’sAirNowtool, and help forecast air quality and issue public health guidance. But air quality scientists worry that EPA budget and job cuts willmake it difficultto get air quality information to people, endangering public health. And when it comes to longer-term research, some experts say community monitors won’t fill in the gap.\n",
      "7. The Trump administrationannounced planslast month to reorganize the agency and cut staff back to levels last seen in the Reagan era, which could mean the elimination of thousands of jobs. The EPA’s proposed budget for 2026would halve its funding, from $9.14 billion to $4.16 billion.\n",
      "8. “This is really disappointing,” said Christi Chester-Schroeder, lead air quality scientist at IQAir, a free platform. “And honestly, it is sort of antithetical, in the sense that the healthcare costs associated with breathing poor quality error are really significant globally.”\n",
      "9. Along with proposed cuts to grants forstate and localair quality management and pollution control, the EPA isplanning to restructurehow it regulates air quality,dismantlingtwo officeschargedwith regulating air and climate pollution and running such programs: the Office of Atmospheric Protection and the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards.\n",
      "10. The EPA plans to create two new offices to clear abacklogofstate plansto meet national air quality standards. A spokesperson said in an email that the new Office of State Air Partnerships would “improve coordination with state, local, and tribal air permitting agencies” to “resolve permitting concerns more efficiently and ensure EPA is working with states, not against them, to advance our shared mission.” The Office of Clean Air Programs would “align statutory obligations and essential functions with centers of expertise to create greater transparency in our regulatory work.”\n",
      "11. Pushback on staffing and funding cuts has been constant. A U.S. District Court judge in Marylandruled last week that the agency’s terminationof $600 million in grants to help communities address pollution was unlawful. And the largest federal workers union was part of a coalition thatsuedthis spring to halt cuts. A federal judgeruled in their favorin May, blocking new layoff and reorganization notices.\n",
      "12. “EPA is complying with the court’s preliminary injunction,” said an EPA spokesperson of the lawsuit in an email. “In line with the court’s order and guidance received by the Department of Justice, EPA is moving forward with only reorganization planning activities.”\n",
      "13. But the agency has already been hamstrung, according to Cathleen Kelly, a senior fellow at the left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress, who said that eliminating the current air monitoring offices would harm research and public health — even if some of their components are preserved elsewhere.\n",
      "14. “It will leave communities more vulnerable when wildfire smoke makes the air unhealthy to breathe, for example, or when corporate polluters release unlawful amounts of pollution and on bad air quality days that increase asthma attacks and land kids and adults that are struggling to breathe in the hospital,” she said.\n",
      "15. Overall, air quality in the U.S. hasimprovedin the decades since the Clean Air Act was enacted in 1970 and began more strictly regulating industrial pollution. The EPA’s own sophisticated monitors have been able to track changes over time, confirming how effective air quality regulations are.\n",
      "16. That progress has been curtailed as wildfire smoke hasbecome more prevalent, and even one bad wildfire season can put thehealth of communitiesat risk, with Indigenous nations,low-incomecommunities, andcommunities of colordisproportionately affected. The American Lung Association saysnearly half of Americanslive with unhealthy levels of air pollution, and that wildfire smoke is a major factor. It can spread far from its source, affecting urban areas that are already dealing with pollution from industry and transportation as well asrural communitieswith less monitoring because they have fewer people.\n",
      "17. As the EPA seeks to cut jobs, some experts worry there won’t be the staff — or the institutional expertise — to process and distribute that data even if air quality monitors continue to collect readings. And as the EPA guts environmental regulations, likerolling back clean air rules for power plants, it may be harder for scientists to properly assess impacts to public health.\n",
      "18. “That’s, to me, the most concerning consequence,” said Tarik Benmarhnia, a professor of environmental epidemiology at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography who studies wildfire smoke.\n",
      "19. The main hazard in wildfire smoke is PM 2.5, or particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns (a millionth of a meter). This is bad for anyone to breathe, but especially hazardous for those with asthma or heart conditions. As wildfire smoke travels through the atmosphere, it also changes chemically to produce the toxic gas ozone, making breathing the stuff even more hazardous.\n",
      "20. Canadian scientists are also worried that the fires are burning across soilsheavily polluted by mining operations, so the smoke could be laced with toxicants like arsenic and lead.\n",
      "21. As climate change exacerbates droughts and raises temperatures — which sucks up the moisture in vegetation — more landscapes are burning and loading the atmosphere with smoke.Recent researchhas shown that the human health impact of PM 2.5 from wildfire smoke can be up to 10 times higher than other sources of particulate matter, said Benmarhnia. Astudypublished last month in the journal Communications Earth and Environment found that between 2006 and 2020, climate change contributed to 15,000 deaths due to particulate matter from wildfire smoke.\n",
      "22. To understand how wildfire smoke is affecting people’s health and warn them of its dangers, it needs to be measured. Places like the Great Lakes that aren’t used to dealing with wildfires and their fallout are just now solidifying public health awareness campaigns.\n",
      "23. “The first statewide air quality alert for fine particulate matter from wildfire smoke was in 2023,” said Aaron Ferguson, who manages the Climate and Tracking Unit at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. “That’s really when we first started developing a lot of our public health guidance and response strategies.”\n",
      "24. That work relies in part on more than40 air quality stationsrun by the state through EPA grants that are still in place for now.\n",
      "25. Increasingly, federal air quality monitors have been supplemented by private companies andcommunity monitoringefforts, including among tribal nations, rural areas and places federal and state governments have neglected. Free services like PurpleAir and IQAir provide hyper-local air quality readings for people to determine if they need to shelter from wildfire smoke.\n",
      "26. “What people are using this for is to decide when to let the kids out with asthma, or when to go cycling if they’re an athlete,” said Adrian Dybwad, CEO and founder of PurpleAir.\n",
      "27. Pierce Mayville, the air quality scientist for the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, said those monitors are “huge” when it comes to getting people usable, practical information, providing near-real-time information about air quality. They have one and are setting up another.\n",
      "28. “If we see the level really high in the purple, then we let people know,” Mayville said. “People can look at the map and see a live-time view of what’s going on so they can keep track of the air quality in their area.”\n",
      "29. What Benmarhnia and other scientists need is a steady stream of reliable data, especially from advanced sensors that determine the composition of wildfire smoke, like if it contains heavy metals. Cheaper instruments just measure the amount of PM 2.5 in the air, not what it’s made of. They can then correlate that data with hospital emissions in a given area to get insights into what makes wildfire emissions so deadly.\n",
      "30. “In order to be able to better test these hypotheses, we need these federally funded monitors and networks and data,” Benmarhnia said. “This is critical. Without that, it would be impossible to do this type of research and better understand what is going on.”\n",

      "=== Funding for further EHR deployments ‘vitally important,’ VA secretary says ===\n",
      "1. Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins testifies during the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies hearing on the fiscal 2026 budget request for the Veterans Affairs Department in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on June 24, 2025.Bill Clark / CQ-Roll Call, Inc / Getty Images\n",
      "2. Stay Connected\n",
      "3. Edward Graham\n",
      "4. Fully deploying the Department of Veterans Affairs’ new electronic health record system is necessary for streamlining veteran care and retaining clinicians, VA Secretary Doug Collins told members of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies on Tuesday.\n",
      "5. VA first signed a $10 billion contract — later revised to over $16 billion — with Cerner in May 2018 to modernize its legacy health record system and make it interoperable with the Pentagon’s new health record, which was also provided by Cerner. Oracle later acquired Cerner in 2022 and rebranded the new unit as Oracle Health.\n",
      "6. Problems with VA’s EHR software arose, however, almost as soon as it was first rolled out in 2020 at the Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center in Spokane, Washington. Patient safety concerns, performance glitches and usability challenges plagued the system, leading to VA paused the modernization project in April 2023 until it could address problems at the sites where the software had been deployed. As of this month, the new EHR system has been implemented at just six of VA’s 170 medical centers.\n",
      "7. VA announced in December that it was moving out of its operational pause and planned to roll out the new system at four Michigan-based medical sites in mid-2026. Collins subsequently announced in March that the department was planning to deploy the software at nine additional medical facilities next year, bringing the total to 13 sites.\n",
      "8. During Tuesday’shearingon VA’s fiscal year 2026 budget, Collins told lawmakers that VA’s continued use of its current EHR system — the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture, or VistA — affects the retention of healthcare professionals across the agency’s operations. VistA runs on a programming language called MUMPS that some have argued is outdated.\n",
      "9. “You're using a system that's costing us literally hundreds of millions of dollars, that's used nowhere else in the world except the VA,” Collins said, alluding to VistA. “So we need to move forward on this [modernization effort].”\n",
      "10. He said VA has also worked to streamline engagement with their Oracle Health counterparts and to promote standardization across the sites using the new EHR software and added that “we had about a 10% gap to where VA would have our uniqueness [in coding].”\n",
      "11. Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich. — who noted that four of next year’s planned site rollouts are located in his state — called the EHR modernization project “a complex endeavor” and pressed Collins about how he would ensure that future software deployments are not beset by additional outages, slowdowns and disruptions.\n",
      "12. “That's why the funding for this is so vitally important,” Collins said. “Because I can't emphasize enough, if we do not transform this system, it hurts our community care process because our doctors cannot communicate with the community [or] our doctors internally.”\n",
      "13. The Trump administration’sFY26 budget proposal—released on May 2 — requests $3.5 billion overall for the deployment of the new EHR system, which represents a roughly $2.2 billion boost over the agency’s FY25 ask for the project.\n",
      "14. Collins told lawmakers last month that he hopes successful rollouts of the system next yearwill lead to faster rolloutsmoving forward, with a goal of “probably the addition of 20 to 25 more” deployments at medical facilities in fiscal year 2027.\n",
      "15. Last week, VA Deputy Secretary Paul Lawrencetouted the progressthe agency was already making ahead of next year’s planned rollouts and said deployment activities were already occurring at 11 of the 13 sites. He said VA was planning to begin activities at the two remaining facilities by the end of the month, and that the agency was hoping to fully implement the system at every VA medical facility by 2031.\n",
      "16. Peters noted that surveys conducted during VA’s operational pause showed that efforts to right the modernization project were on track, with the number of system interruptions affecting clinicians decreasing, while veteran trust in the facilities where the system had been deployed was increasing. But he still expressed some concern about plans to restart deployments, given previous problems with the initiative.\n",

      "=== Lawmakers spar over DOGE as Republicans look to lock in cuts ===\n",
      "1. DOGE Subcommittee chair Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., speaks during a hearing on trans people in women's sports on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on May 7, 2025. Greene and other Republicans on the committee spared with Democrats on teh effectiveness of DOGE and its efforts at a June 24 hearing.OLIVER CONTRERAS/AFP via Getty Images\n",
      "2. Stay Connected\n",
      "3. Natalie Alms\n",
      "4. Republicans and Democrats traded jabs on Tuesday over the work of the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency during a DOGE subcommittee hearing.\n",
      "5. “We need to lock in DOGE savings for the taxpayers, and we should also be thinking about locking in the DOGE process that has produced these savings,” said Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., the head of the House Committee Oversight and Government Reform’s DOGE subcommittee, saying that the government is like an “overgrown, out-of-control animal.”\n",
      "6. Trump set up DOGE on his first day in office with a purported focus on tech, cost savings and efficiency, although since then the group’s efforts have been wide-ranging, including effectively shutting down entire agencies. Cost savings from the effort have fallen far short of Musk’s trillion-dollar goal, and DOGE’s public tally of cost savings has been riddled with errors. Critics say the unit's work has actually made many government processes less efficient.\n",
      "7. Billionaire Elon Musk stepped back from DOGE weeks ago, but the office’s associates remain dispersed across agencies. The administration is also seeking$45 millionin funding for DOGE next year.\n",
      "8. “To win this war, we need to make sure these cuts aren’t just temporary,” said Greene. “That means passing laws to streamline agencies, eliminate redundant programs and give the president the authority to fire bureaucrats who don’t do their jobs.”\n",
      "9. Republican lawmakers are trying to push through a $9 billion rescission package that they say is meant to cement DOGE priorities with cuts to foreign aid and public broadcasting. They’re also up against a looming July 4 goal to pass a tax and spending reconciliation package to extend and expand tax cuts and enact priorities like immigration enforcement. Democrats noted that such a package is projected toadd to the deficit.\n",
      "10. Democrats pushed back on the premise that DOGE is about efficiencies or savings.\n",
      "11. “All of this talk about lowering costs and reducing waste is absolute BS. Their agenda is about one thing: making the federal government so weak that they can exploit it for their personal gain,” said Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, who tried to subpoena Musk during the hearing. Republicans blocked the request, as they have with previous attempts.\n",
      "12. Greene said that DOGE is working to reduce waste, fraud and abuse. But since January, the Trump administration hasfiredmany inspectors general, whose job it is to fight waste, fraud and abuse in agencies, despite the White House’s purported focus on those issues.\n",
      "13. “We came to the table at the beginning of this whole process in good faith with real ideas, bipartisan ideas, that folks have been working on for years and a desire to actually fix and modernize the federal government, what we've seen from DOGE is the exact opposite,” said the top Democrat on the subcommittee, Rep. Melanie Stansbury, D-N.M.\n",
      "14. “We all agree the government should be more efficient. We all agree that we should cut waste. We all agree that there should be bipartisan pathways forward to make the government operate in a modern manner,” Stansbury added. “But that's not what this enterprise is all about.”\n",
      "15. Some Democrats —and their witness Emily DiVito of the Groundwork Collaborative, an economic policy think tank — pointed to Social Security as an example of the negative impact of DOGE. The Trump administration is pushing to shrink its workforce by thousands, and SSA has been at the center of headlines for customer service problems.\n",
      "16. In May, the agencyreversedan anti-fraud policy that slowed down retirement processing after it foundessentially no fraud. It was put in place after DOGE and White House leaders repeated false claims about fraud levels on SSA phone lines.\n",
      "17. “[DOGE has] led to poor services, a brain drain on our federal government, and it’s going to cost taxpayers money long term,” said Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Va.\n",

      "=== National Parks scramble to fill top leadership positions, but fix could create more vacancies ===\n",
      "1. Interior Secretary Douglas Burgum testifies before Senate Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Department of Interior, Environment and Related Agencies at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on May 21, 2025.John McDonnell / Getty Images\n",
      "2. Stay Connected\n",
      "3. Eric Katz\n",
      "4. The National Park Service is scrambling to fill top-level leadership positions at posts throughout the country, launching a new initiative to fill dozens of vacant roles that some inside the agency fear will only create new openings at other sites.\n",
      "5. Dubbed “Operation Opportunity,” NPS is soliciting applications for openings at the superintendent, deputy superintendent and chief of facilities level at a variety of park locations. Due to an ongoing governmentwide hiring freeze, however, the positions are only open to internal applicants within the Interior Department.\n",
      "6. That will limit those qualified for the lateral moves to employees already working in similar roles, according to a source involved in the initiative, meaning anyone who takes one of the jobs would be very likely creating a similar vacancy elsewhere within NPS. The vacancies currently being filled have been deemed high priority positions and are categorized at or among the top ranks of the civil service.\n",
      "7. Among the open positions are the superintendents for the National Parks of Big Bend, Glacier Bay and White Sands, the deputy superintendent for Glacier and Indiana Dunes and the chief of facilities at Yosemite. The list includes top openings at a myriad of additional national historic and other NPS sites, such as Martin Luther King National Historic Park in Atlanta.\n",
      "8. The number of vacancies among the top ranks at parks is expected to grow once those who accepted “deferred resignations”—and are currently sitting on administrative leave through September—are officially off the rolls.\n",
      "9. The source familiar with the initiative voiced concern that due to the nature of the internal postings—Operation Opportunity is open only for “lateral reassignments\"—the only people who would be qualified are those “who are at the level and already have the experience.” If they are accepted into the positions, their existing roles would then become vacant. Operation Opportunity originally launched in April, but agency leadership has “chaotically” asked HR to quickly post the dozens of park leadership positions. The urgency of the directive reflected a newfound pressure to fill the roles, the source said.\n",
      "10. An Interior spokesperson saidGovernment Executivewas seeking to \"skew the creation of new job opportunities for the American people.\"\n",
      "11. \"The department is thrilled to be posting and filling new positions at our treasured national parks,\" the spokesperson said. \"This administration is committed to expanding the workforce and investing in our beautiful parks - which are open and ready to visit!\"\n",
      "12. The agency is also dealing with staffing issues at the rank-and-file level. As of last month, the National Parks Conservation Association found NPS staffing was down 13% overall since President Trump took office. It also found that while Burgum pledged to hire as many as 7,700 seasonal employees for the peak summer season, NPS had onboarded just 3,300. That hiring was delayed as seasonal staff were initiallysubject to the hiring freeze. NPCA found there were around 100 total vacant superintendent positions.\n",
      "13. The source familiar with the initiative noted that seasonal hiring has been hampered by Trump administration policies.\n",
      "14. “Positions which were super easy to fill last year have had bone dry applicant pools and tons of declinations because people are scared to take a federal job,” the source said, or because they “don’t want to work for this administration.”\n",
      "15. The agency is also expected tolay off around 1,500 employeesif the Supreme Court allows the Trump administration to move forward with its planned reductions in force, though Burgum has insisted the cuts will not impact park operations and has demanded that no park can reduce its hours or services without headquarters approval.\n",
      "16. During congressional testimony earlier this month, Burgum reiterated to lawmakers that layoffs would not affect parks and said superintendent openings were being filled on a temporary basis.\n",
      "17. “We're trying to cut jobs that aren't in parks,” the secretary said to Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colo. “And if there's a vacancy to superintendent [positions], we fill it with the deputy. So it's incorrect for you to say that we have—we have vacancies because when a superintendent takes early retirement, superintendents are at the end of their career.”\n",
      "18. Theresa Pierno, NPCA’s president, said Burgum was being dishonest in his testimony.\n",
      "19. “Secretary Burgum’s narrative doesn’t match the reality unfolding in our parks,” Pierno said. “The Park Service is in a full-blown staffing crisis.\n",

      "1. Senator Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., speaks at a rally at the US Capitol on April 10, 2025 in Washington, DC. Blumenthal and Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, called on the VA Inspector General June 13 to examine the agency's use of AI to cancel contracts.Jemal Countess/Getty Images for Fair Share America\n",
      "2. Stay Connected\n",
      "3. Edward Graham\n",
      "4. Two senators on the panel overseeing the Department of Veterans Affairs are pressing the agency’s inspector general to probe VA’s mass contract cancellations and the role that artificial intelligence played in determining the agreements that would be terminated.\n",
      "5. In aJune 13-dated letterto VA Inspector General David Case that was publicly released on Monday, Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Angus King, I-Maine, called for the agency watchdog to review the hundreds of VA contracts cancelled by the Department of Government Efficiency since the start of the Trump administration.\n",
      "6. Blumenthal is the ranking member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, and King is also a member of the committee.\n",
      "7. In line with DOGE’s cost-cutting efforts, VA Secretary Doug Collins has announced that the agency is looking at letting go of as many as 83,000 employees across its operations this year to return to its 2019 staffing levels. Collins similarlyannouncedin March that VA was cancelling “585 non-mission-critical or duplicative contracts,” with plans to cancel additional agreements as the agency continued its review.\n",
      "8. In both instances, Collins stressed that the efforts are designed to streamline VA’s operations and to limit unnecessary spending, and that they would not affect mission-critical programs.\n",
      "9. The lawmakers — who wrote that VA has cancelled over 650 contracts through the end of May — said, however, that a preliminary review of the terminated agreements found that “a majority appear to be for services directly for veterans or critical VA operations to include for safe health care delivery,” and that it also seemed as though the agency did not perform the necessary planning needed before undertaking the mass cancellations.\n",
      "10. They also cited aJune 6 ProPublica investigation“that found evidence that DOGE and VA officials used ill-conceived Artificial Intelligence (AI) formulas and algorithms to make or inform contract cancellation decisions — cutting out meaningful input from VA career experts to assess the impact of ending these services.”\n",
      "11. Blumenthal similarly pointed to the news report about the use of AI duringa Democrat-only June 10 spotlight forum, saying at the time that he supported cutting waste at VA but that “the way to focus on it is thoughtfully and factually, not to use AI and identify keywords in the contract that then result in wholesale slashing.”\n",
      "12. The two lawmakers said the use of AI to identify contracts for termination “adds an entire new level of unease connected to the decision-making, security, governance, and quality control of the entire process.”\n",
      "13. In an interview with ProPublica, the DOGE employee who created the AI tool that was used to identify contracts for “munching” — or cancellation — at VA told the outlet that “mistakes were made” by his program. He also said that analyzing VA’s nearly 90,000 contracts within the 30-day period outlined by President Donald Trump’s February executive order mandating such a review of agencies’ “spending on contracts, grants and loans” would have been impossible without developing the AI tool.\n",
      "14. In addition to pressing the IG to investigate the impact of the cancelled contracts on veterans and VA as a whole, Blumenthal and King also requested that the watchdog look into “the use of AI and/or algorithms to guide decision-making to include the recipient and purpose” of each VA contract identified for termination.\n",
      "15. The lawmakers also asked that the IG review “the formal assignment and instructions given” to the DOGE employee to determine if they included the use of AI, as well as look into whether there were data privacy safeguards in place for the contract information run through the AI tool and “the extent to which this and any other related use of AI by DOGE or the VA violated any policy, procedure, regulation, or statute.”\n",

      "3. Sean Michael Newhouse\n",
      "4. Almost as soon asDr. Laura Cheeverfound out that she was being honored for her decades of leadership at the Health and Human Services Department, she thought it was somewhat peculiar to be receiving an individual recognition.\n",
      "5. “When they first called…they said, ‘We want you to talk to us about whatyoudid,” Cheever recalled. “I think that to be successful in government you have to be able to work well in teams and to collaborate and to see possibilities and partnerships.”\n",
      "6. Cheever is one of 23 current and former federal employees who received a 2025 Samuel J. Heyman Service to America medal (Sammie), an awards program that the Partnership for Public Service has sponsored since 2002 for outstanding civil servants. This year, however, the nonpartisan good government group had to contend with the Trump administration’s cuts to agency workforces and efforts to weaken the independence of the civil service.\n",
      "7. “I was really, one, honored to have received an award, and, two, really pleased that they were able to find a way to do it,” Cheever said.\n",
      "8. While she is nearly six months into a “long-planned retirement” that was “not related to elections,” Cheever spent more than two decades leading theRyan White HIV/AIDS Program, which provides medical and other support to low-income people with HIV and annually assists more than half of all people in the U.S. with HIV, estimated at about 500,000 individuals.\n",
      "9. Her involvement with treating HIV began while she was doing medical training in San Francisco in the 1990s. She then moved to Baltimore for similar work during which time medicines started emerging that stopped an HIV diagnosis from automatically meaning a death sentence.\n",
      "10. “I was very interested in making sure that as many people as possible could get started on these medications as quickly as possible,” Cheever said. “I saw that working for the federal government, I would be able to really increase that impact exponentially, and that's why I went to work for the federal government from a position that I loved in academia.”\n",
      "11. At the end of 2024, HHS announced that arecord-breaking 90.6%of individuals with HIV receiving medical care through Ryan White were virally suppressed, meaning they are on medication that prevents sexual transmission of the virus. This is a roughly 20% increase from 2010 and higher than the national viral suppression rate of 65%.\n",
      "12. Cheever is worried, however, that proposed cuts to public health care funding in congressional Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act(H.R. 1)and the Trump administration’s anti-LGBTQ+ policies could impede that progress.\n",
      "13. “If Medicaid or Medicare were to drastically be reduced or otherwise cut people off from being able to access care, or people are scared to come to care because they are transgender or gay or whatever those issues are going to be for people in this current environment, that is what makes me very, very concerned about the nation as a whole making progress,” she said.\n",
      "14. She’s also apprehensive about the ability of agencies to bring on top-tier talent in the future.\n",
      "15. “I've recruited many, many very talented people to come into federal government, and I've been able to tell them, quite honestly, that in every administration I've worked in, Democrat, Republican, all sorts of different people, we always had amazing opportunities to pursue our work. We had to shift the work, but our core mission and values really had not changed over time,” she said. “I'm not sure I could tell that to people today.”\n",

      "19. Studies on that sample have found molecules that are key to life, suggesting,according to NASA, that “the conditions necessary for the emergence of life were widespread across the early solar system [and] increasing the odds life could have formed on other planets and moons.”\n",

      "22. But to reach that discovery, Burns and his team faced a barrage of complications.\n",
      "23. “OSIRIS-REx was really just a series of crises once we got to the asteroid,” he said.\n",
      "24. The asteroid Bennu had an unexpectedly rugged surface, which created difficulties for landing. The spacecraft also collected too much rock, which briefly prevented the lid on its sample collection capsule from closing. And when it returned to Earth, one of its two parachutes didn’t work.\n",
      "25. “The first parachute didn't open. There was a lot of tension in the sample return event,” he said. “The main parachute did open and deployed successfully, and everything was okay in the end because the system was designed robustly.”\n",

      "=== Most fed-targeting provisions in Senate reconciliation bill don’t pass Byrd muster ===\n",
      "1. The doors to the Senate Parliamentarian's office are seen in the U.S. Capitol on June 23, 2025. The Senate Finance Committee began its “Byrd Bath” review process of President Donald Trump's “One Big Beautiful Bill\" Act. This process refers to a specific review of legislation named after the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.V.Kayla Bartkowski / Getty Images\n",
      "2. Stay Connected\n",
      "3. Erich Wagner\n",
      "4. A series of plans targeting federal workers’ retirement benefits, their unions and civil service protections were dealt a setback over the weekend when the Senate parliamentarian warned that they violate rules governing budget reconciliation initiatives.\n",
      "5. Last week, Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Rand Paul, R-Ky., unveiled his panel’s portion of congressional Republicans’ budget reconciliation package, which aims to reduce federal spending to partially pay for extended tax cuts for the ultrawealthy and increased immigration enforcement. Themeasure abandoneda series of House-passed proposals to cut the retirement benefits of currently serving federal workers but would have required future federal hires topay nearly 15%of their paychecks toward their retirement benefits if they wished to accrue civil service protections.\n",
      "6. But Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., top Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, announced Sunday that the Senate parliamentarian had ruled that most of the Senate’s proposals governing federal benefits and workforce policies violated the Byrd rule, which aims to limit reconciliation measure—and its simple majority threshold for passage—to topics that are budgetary in nature.\n",
      "7. “There is no better way to define this big beautiful betrayal of a bill than families lose and billionaires win,” he said. “Democrats are on the side of families and workers and are scrutinizing this bill piece by piece to ensure Republicans can’t use the reconciliation process to force their anti-worker policies on the American people. The Byrd Rule is enshrined in law for a reason, and Democrats are making sure it is enforced.”\n",
      "8. Provisions that would require a 60-vote majority to advance include the plan to require all new federal employees to pay 9.4% toward the Federal Employees Retirement System and to choose between paying an additional 5 percentage points toward FERS or serving as at-will employees; a requirement that federal employees challenging an adverse action before the Merit Systems Protection Board pay a $350 filing fee, as well as a proposal to charge federal employee unions for use of agency property and official time on a quarterly basis.\n",
      "9. The parliamentarian also said that a provision effectively giving the Trump administration “carte blanche” to reorganize federal agencies and lay off thousands of federal workers would similarly run afoul of the Byrd rule. Earlier this month, Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters that he would not consider overruling the parliamentarian as part of the bid to send the reconciliation package to President Trump’s desk by July 4.\n",
      "10. Still remaining in the package is a provision tasking the Office of Personnel Management with conducting an audit of enrollees in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program to ensure family members remain eligible as dependents, and a requirement that the government charge a 10% fee on deductions from federal workers paychecks, such as unions dues and charitable contributions as part of the Combined Federal Campaign.\n",
      "11. In a statement, National Treasury Employees Union National President Doreen Greenwald praised the rulings.\n",
      "12. “We are glad the Senate parliamentarian agreed that many of the harmful federal employee provisions contained in the draft budget reconciliation package were not a real attempt to save money, but instead an attempt to use the budget reconciliation process to make significant changes to civil service policies,” she said. “As this process continues to move forward, NTEU will keep up the fight to protect employee pay, benefits and workforce rights from those who are determined to harm frontline federal employees around the country who work hard every day to serve the American people, and to weaken the unions that represent them.”\n",

      "=== OPM’s new performance management rules are (mostly) spot on ===\n",
      "1. Illustration by OpenAI\n",
      "2. Stay Connected\n",
      "3. Ronald Sanders\n",
      "4. The Office of Personnel Management has just issued detailed new requirements for agency performance management systems, and while I will take issue with some of the details on technical and policy grounds—especially anything that even hints at political partisanship—I think they’re a step in the right direction, especially insofar as they take on things like the perennial problem of inflated, “everybody gets a medal” annual performance ratings.\n",
      "5. Yes, those new rules are incredibly detailed, particularly if they’re intended as the “be all and end all” of federal performance management. As promulgated, they leave little to no room for federal agencies to field systems that are equally rigorous but better reflect their different missions and cultures. Thus, the new rules may be construed as “one size fits all” in that regard. I hope I’m wrong, because if they work as clearly intended—that is, by setting a governmentwide floor for this year’s performance cycle and beyond—they needn’t be.\n",
      "6. More agency realism and the ‘floor’ established by OPM\n",
      "7. If the new standards are intended as “the minimum daily adult requirement” for performance evaluation—one that brings sorely needed rigor and realism to a critical management activity that unfortunately, has lapsed—then they’re a net positive. And I would argue that like a spoonful of castor oil, they’re necessary. Too many agencies have surrendered when it comes to the real burdens and return on investment of performance management, opting to make the process so simple as to become largely irrelevant, a necessary evil required by law, as in, “Okay, if we have to do it, let’s make it as painless as possible.”  To me, that looks too much like waving a white flag.\n",
      "8. Take so-called “pass-fail” systems. OPM’s new rules ban them, and that couldn’t come fast enough. Under such systems (and they’ve proliferated), almost no one fails and virtually everyone passes. I don’t know if our civil servants are that good, but I do think that most employees don’t really like pass-fail, as they allow managers to avoid making often-difficult distinctions in employee performance. Even though everyone knows they exist (especially the employees themselves).\n",
      "9. The fact is that employees perform at different levels, the result of a whole host of factors like training, fit, ability, motivation, work habits, distractions at home (and work) and yes, just plain old bureaucracy...inefficiencies that have festered over the years. But that doesn’t mean surrender. Just the opposite!\n",
      "10. Maybe we’ve lapsed because the stakes are so low. When it comes to pay, an employee’s compensation is basically on automatic pilot (even the Government Accountability Office says so!), a function of the time clock and a pulse. Seniority and survival prevail over high performance, at least to date. And while OPM’s new standards attempt to use current law to reward that high performance, the fact is that the decades-old General Schedule was just not built to do so.\n",
      "11. Requiring (often hard) performance distinctions is a good thing\n",
      "12. Or maybe it’s because we don’t invest in and support our managers when they make those difficult distinctions. That too needs to be addressed, but at the agency level. With some exceptions, like the now semi-permanent Acquisition and Lab “Demonstration Projects” in DOD, performance distinctions made by managers have no real consequences, so it’s no wonder that many of them just don’t bother to make those distinctions.\n",
      "13. I don’t blame them—we’ve given them too much to do and not enough training to do it—but at the same time, that doesn’t mean we need to accept that everyone’s performance is the same and should therefore receive the same (typically inflated) rating. That’s just not true and getting real when it comes to annual ratings is worth tackling.\n",
      "14. That also applies to retention, and OPM gets credit for tilting at that windmill too. Today, retention is pretty much automatic. Non-probationary employees almost always get a job for life and then receive as much as a 35% increase in salary—from Step 1 to Step 10 in the GS system—just by virtue of patience, pulse and an “acceptable level of competence” (whatever that means).\n",
      "15. Some (hopefully many) employees may really be motivated by public service and do not care about performance, pay and/or retention distinctions, but my own experience says otherwise.\n",
      "16. Equity theory says performance distinctions matter\n",
      "17. You see, I’m a proponent of ‘equity theory’ when it comes to motivation. It says that one pays close attention to the efforts of one’s co-workers, what they “give” on the job and what they “get” for it in return. It suggests that employees will adjust their efforts up or down to ensure “equity.” But in my cynical experience, if an idealistic, high performing “baby” civil servant sees more seasoned co-workers just punching the time clock, that person will eventually do the same. After all, it’s just not worth the extra effort, at least so says equity theory.\n",
      "18. Of course, I’m generalizing, as workers are motivated by a whole host of things. But the decades-old GS system generalizes too. When its rules explicitly say that time-in-grade matters above all else, many employees will behave that way. That does not mean that they or their peers do not (or did not) have what Jim Perry calls “public service motivation” but the weight of that system, permeating every aspect of one’s working life, may eventually dull if not destroy that intrinsic motivation.\n",
      "19. Among other things, one way to combat that resultant apathy is to focus on performance management, both day-to-day and over time, and OPM’s attempt to control ratings inflation, as well as to ban pass-fail systems, are both good. Not easy. But good. Many of today’s performance appraisal systems just ooze mediocrity. They implicitly (and unintentionally?) encourage and reward it, and while that mediocrity may be okay for some, I think American citizens, as well as most federal civil servants, have soundly rejected that notion.\n",
      "20. Thus, I think employees actually want managers to make performance distinctions (their own, as well as peers’), so long as they’re seen as fair and accurate. Achieving that has always been the challenge, but that’s a problem worth spending some time on. What’s not are pass-fail systems that simply give up and say all employees are alike when it comes to their performance, when everyone knows that they are not.\n",
      "21. We need more accountability, not less\n",
      "22. A quick word about my friendErich Wagner’s excellent story inGovernment Executiveon this subject, in which an anonymous HR director is quoted as saying the new rules ignore two harsh realities: the current system’s lack of pay consequences, and its impact on RIFs. I agree with that assessment, but in contrast to that unnamed source, I think that impact is a net positive.\n",
      "23. I’ve already talked about the need to make individual performance and pay distinctions matter, but there are problems with the governmentwide system that need fixing too. Thus, while governmentwide pay “comparability” has been a problem for the federal civil service almost since its inception (for example how do you value tangible benefits like pensions?), tackling that problem—perhaps by modernizing the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act—is also something we seem to be avoiding.\n",
      "24. I didn’t do so when I chaired the Federal Salary Council, but my efforts to “reform” that law (and fully fund those government agencies that implement it) largely fell on deaf ears. It’s just too convenient to rail in the media about the seemingly intractable but in my view, mythical “pay gap” between federal and non-federal employees, rather than try to reduce it through methodological fixes like more occupational differentiation (something the labor market does as a matter of course), vs. paying some far more than the market says they deserve...and some far less.\n",
      "25. Erich’s unnamed source also suggested that the new rules will have an impact on RIF. I agree, but for good reasons, not bad. The performance management system should makemoreperformance distinctions when we run a RIF, not less! Indeed, I think performance distinctions, if meaningful, ought to be determinative when an agency retrenches. But like so many other things, that too has become irrelevant. We should want to retain our best, highest performers—not our most senior ones—when we RIF and I hope the “new” OPM encourages agencies to do so.\n",
      "26. Bottom line: Give OPM an ‘A’ for effort...but with some caveats\n",
      "27. The bottom line here is that OPM’s new standards are pretty good, especially if you 1. shed any hint of political partisanship—we haven’t talked about that, but I’d refer you to Erich’s article, as it does a good job of pointing those out in order to preserve a nonpartisan civil service—2. back off of any plug for forced ratings distribution, in favor of more realism and—3. allow for more stringent, agency-based systems that better reflect government’s variety of missions and measures.\n",
      "28. But as I said above, I’m old school in that regard, as well as a naively optimistic “glass half full” person, and I will always argue that we should keep and reward our very best civil servants, even if that’s hard! So, the new OPM rules, especially if clarified as I hope, are a step in the right direction. Now, if only there are people still willing to come work for the federal government, after all the DOGE carnage and talk about “throat slashing.” But that’s another matter.\n",

Under orders from Trump, U.S. bombers struck the Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan nuclear facilities in Iran on Saturday night, escalating a yearslong tension between the two nations that occurred amid back and forth talks seeking to deter Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Just over a week ago, Israel launched itsown incursionagainst Iranian military officials and scientists, on grounds that Iran was closer than ever before to having nuclear weapon capabilities.\n",
      "8. The aim of the strikes was to destroy “Iran’s nuclear enrichment capacity” and eliminate “the nuclear threat posed by the world’s No. 1 state sponsor of terror,” Trump said Saturday night. “The strikes were a spectacular military success.”\n",

Iranian hackers tend to launch distributed denial of service attacks — designed to overwhelm a webpage with bot traffic until the page crashes — against aerospace, oil, gas and telecommunications entities, Brian Harrell, a former DHS assistant secretary who served in Trump’s first term, said in a statement toNextgov/FCW.\n",
      "12. An Iranian hacker group on Sundayclaimed responsibilityfor temporarily shuttering Truth Social, Trump’s signature social media platform. The denial of service attack occurred just after Trump announced the strikes on the nuclear targets.\n",
      "13. “Iran’s cyber strategy is likely [in] cooperation with Russia, which given current tensions, could be a real possibility.

      "=== OPM calls for quicker firings, more stringent performance standards ===\n",
      "1. The OPM memo also calls on agencies to make better use of firing and disciplinary authorities, as well as to shorten performance improvement plans to 30 days.Douglas Rissing / Getty Images\n",
      "2. Stay Connected\n",
      "3. Erich Wagner\n",
      "4. The Office of Personnel Management this week released new guidance calling on federal agencies to rate fewer employees as above average or outstanding and to discipline or fire federal workers more quickly.\n",
      "5. Much like OPM’shiring plan, anew memofrom acting OPM Director Charles Ezell to agency heads makes overtures toward the nonpartisan issue of improving performance management in government, but introduces partisan elements that could threaten the effectiveness of those reforms, experts say.\n",
      "6. “For many decades now, performance management across the federal workforce has fallen short of what the American people should expect,” Ezell wrote. “Too often, this has resulted in a lack of accountability and inflated performance ratings. Federal employee performance ratings should be normalized and reflect individual contributions to organizational results and outcomes.”\n",
      "7. To alleviate this, OPM instructed agencies to revise the annual performance plans of federal workers to better delineate between the “fully successful,” “exceeds fully successful” and “outstanding” performance ratings, as well as link an individual’s responsibilities with agency mission delivery. But language in the memo also appears to allude to agencies exploring forced distribution of ratings, which OPM has already moved to adopt for members of theSenior Executive Service, while another provision mandates that performance plans be linked specifically to “Trump administration priorities.”\n",
      "8. A former federal HR official toldGovernment Executivethat while they agreed with the need to address performance inflation, two of the primary causes of that phenomenon—low or no across-the-board federalpay raises, and the threat of reductions in force—show no sign of going away any time soon.\n",
      "9. “We already tie bonuses to your ratings, and a lot of the time that’s the only way for a supervisor to give a little bit more money to staff members that they want to recognize and try and retain,” the official said. “Until [former President] Biden came into office and issued one decent pay raise, the prior 10 years were abysmal, starting with Obama in 2013 with sequestration.”\n",
      "10. The memo also calls on agencies to make better use of firing and disciplinary authorities, as well as to shorten performance improvement plans to 30 days. But much of the reforms are rooted in improving training for supervisors and better communication between managers and frontline workers, and it remains to be seen how that would be paid for or administered, particularly after OPM shuttered the Federal Executive Institute in February.\n",
      "11. “They talk about the importance of training, which is an excellent idea, but it’s not clear where it’s going to come from or who is going to pay for it,” said Don Kettl, professor emeritus and former dean of the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. “In the case of any downsizing in government, training is always the first to go. So is there going to be investment to try to make happen what they’re proposing?”\n",
      "12. The former HR official said the plan to reduce performance improvement plans to 30 days belies the overall memo as a “red herring.”\n",
      "13. “If you can’t articulate why someone’s failing and you only give them 30 days to show that they’re no longer failing, it becomes a procedural widget to sustain a termination,” they said. “[And] the Trump administration has done such a thorough job in the last five months cutting the balls off of unions—which is a mistake, because they help provide due process—and the Merit Systems Protection Board, the [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] and [Office of Special Counsel], it’s going to be hard for current employees under these constraints to win anything.”\n",
      "14. Kettl said that the running theme of the Trump administration’s workforce policy—proposing needed reforms along with politicization efforts that undermine them—seems rooted in a fundamental mistrust of career employees.\n",
      "15. “There’s an old saying: ‘There are two ways that a civil servant can undermine a political appointee: One is to do nothing of what they say, and the other is to do everything that they say,’” he said. “The people who come in with ideas about what ought to happen and what policy ought to be always benefit from the expertise of those who have been doing it a long time, and you can see it reflected in this document. I can see what they’re trying to do, but it would benefit from the people who actually do the work giving it a once-over.”\n",

      "4. Senior Democrats ina letter on Wednesdayobjected to Education Department plans to largely transfer responsibility over certain grant programs to the Labor Department, arguing the move represents another attempt to eliminate the agency without congressional approval.\n",
      "5. According tocourt documents, the departments on May 21 entered into an interagency agreement under which Labor would take over administration of career and technical education assistance grants under the2006 Perkins Actas well asWorkforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Title II grantsfor adult literacy and education programs.\n",
      "6. In their letter to Education Secretary Linda McMahon, the lawmakers wrote that the department lacks the authority to mostly hand over control over the programs, which would involve a transfer of up to $2.7 billion in fiscal 2025 alone.\n",
      "7. “Respectfully, federal agencies are not interchangeable entities that simply hand out money to states and localities,” they wrote. “Instead, each agency provides its own specific expertise in the administration of federal programs, in this case education programs.”\n",
      "8. The letter was signed by Senate Appropriations Committee vice chair Patty Murray, D-Wash., Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies ranking member Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., House Education and Workforce Committee ranking member Bobby Scott, D-Va., and House Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn.\n",
      "9. The members of Congress also expressed frustration that they were not notified about the interagency agreements and predicted that incorporating another department into the programs’ operations would lead to inefficiencies.\n",
      "10. “This likely would mean states, institutions of higher education and school districts would have to work with two federal agencies in the administration of these programs, leading to delays in agency decision-making and grant administration,” they contended.\n",
      "11. The interagency agreement is currently on hold due toan injunction that required Education to bring back its employees who were laid offunder reduction-in-force procedures. Education Chief of Staff Rachel Oglesby wrote in a June 10 court filing that the injunction was preventing the agency from “pursuing operational efficiencies and cost-savings.”\n",
      "12. Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications at Education, said in a statement toGovernment Executivethat the agreement with Labor is “one of many existing agreements ED has with other agencies to collaborate on services for the American people.” She also said that the department would respond to the Democrats’ letter.\n",
      "13. President Donald Trump in March signedan executive order that requires the drawdown of the Education Departmentwhile still preserving many of its programs. Court documents also show that Education, prior to the injunction, was negotiating a memorandum of understanding through which employees would be detailed to the Treasury Department to work on student loan management.\n",

      "4. The White House and its Department of Government Efficiency are spearheading efforts to shake up the Postal Service, according to details of the meetings obtained byGovernment Executive, with topics including pricing for mail and general reform proposals.\n",
      "5. The meetings were not clearly within the scope of a memorandum of understanding former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy signed with DOGE, which focused on specific cost-cutting measures and real estate planning. Some of the meetings also involved top officials from the Treasury Department, White House attorneys and policy advisors and additional USPS executives. A source familiar with the meetings confirmed DOGE has been active at the Postal Service’s Washington headquarters in recent months.\n",
      "6. The meetings began in late March, just days after DeJoy resigned amid pressure from the Trump administration. Acting Postmaster General Doug Tulino met with DOGE the day he was sworn into his new role to discuss ethics, according to details from the meeting. Two DOGE team members—Alex Simonpour and Ethan Shaotran, both of whom haveMOUsoftheir ownwith USPS—were present, along with other postal executives.\n",
      "7. In April, Simonpour and Shaotran met again with Tulino and postal leaders, including Fiona Machado, USPS' director for pricing and costing strategy support. That was followed by another meeting with postal officials, including the new USPS Chief Financial Officer Luke Grossman, to discuss an exigent price increase. The Postal Service can request authority to implement rate hikes outside its normal price caps in emergency situations, which it has not done since 2013. USPS is set to raise the price of a stamp to 78 cents in July, which would mark a 42% increase over the last five years since DeJoy took office.\n",
      "8. In May, Clark Milner, a White House senior advisor for policy, organized a meeting with the DOGE, including James Burnham, its chief attorney, and members of the Domestic Policy Council. Among those in the policy team was James Sherk, an architect of the Trump administration’s initiatives to cut federal rolls and weaken protections afforded by civil service laws.\n",
      "9. Earlier this month, Sherk spearheaded a meeting with officials throughout the administration to discuss postal reform. Among the invitees were the chief of staff, the deputy assistant secretary and the assistant secretary for management at Treasury. Several White House attorneys, policy advisors and a representative from Vice President J.D. Vance’s office were also invited.\n",
      "10. In March, DeJoy sent a letter to lawmakers explaining that DOGE would only be authorized to work with his agency on matters related to USPS retirement plans, workers compensation costs, congressional liaisoning regarding costs incurred by legislative mandates, reforms to its regulatory requirements, retail lease renewals, business opportunities with other federal agencies and counterfeit postage.\n",
      "11. “These are the only initiatives that I have requested and authorized the DOGE team to assist on thus far, and only the data and information required to pursue these initiatives will be provided to the DOGE team members,” DeJoy said.\n",
      "12. While pricing matters and general reform were not included in that list, DeJoy mentioned the Postal Service’s regulator has stood in the way of “timely and necessary changes required to succeed as a self-funded enterprise.” All price hikes, including exigent increases, must receive approval from the Postal Regulatory Commission.\n",
      "13. The Postal Service declined to comment for this story. The White House and Treasury Department did not respond to multiple inquiries.\n",
      "14. David Steiner, a long-time CEO of Waste Management and FedEx board member, will take over as postmaster general in July. Mike Plunkett, long-time postal executive turned president of the Association for Postal Commerce, said it was surprising the current leadership team would be discussing such significant shakeups just two weeks before the organization swears in a new CEO. He added it would be difficult to justify an exigent price hike when the agnecy is already implementing a rate hike next month.\n",
      "15. Prior to taking office this year, Trump suggested he might seek toprivatize USPS entirely—resurrectinga proposal from his first term. Trump said in February, however, that the Postal Service would continue to exist as a public entity even if it was no longer a standalone agency. Elon Musk, who until recently led DOGE’s efforts, subsequently said USPS should be privatized.\n",
      "16. Trump was considering signing an executive order to fold USPS into the Commerce Department,The Washington Postreportedearlier this year, though that plan never came to fruition. Pierre Gentin, a senior advisor to Commerce Department Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trump's nominee to serve as the agency's general counsel, was invited to the June postal reform meeting.\n",

      "5. In a 51-46 party-line vote, the Senate confirmed Rodney Scott of Oklahoma.\n",
      "6. Scott previously served as the chief of the Border Patrol, an agency within CBP, during the first Trump administration and under former President Joe Biden.\n",
      "7. During the first Trump administration, Scott implemented a policy that required asylum-seekers to remain in Mexico while their cases were pending in immigration court.\n",

      "11. “Rather than following the agency’s own policy and immediately referring the incident to outside investigators, the San Diego CBP office began its own investigation,” Wyden said. “In the course of that investigation, the CBP officers taped over the only video copy of Hernández Rojas’s death and tampered with physical evidence, according to court documents.”\n",
      "12. The United States paid $1 million to settle a lawsuit brought by Hernández Rojas’s widow, and in 2015 the Justice Department declined to pursue federal charges against any of the officers or leaders involved in the case.\n",

      "=== Trump watchdog nominees draw congressional scrutiny for political histories ===\n",
      "1. Former Rep. Anthony D'Esposito, R-N.Y., speaks during a news conference outside the U.S. Capitol on Sept. 11, 2024. He is President Donald Trump's nominee to be inspector general for the Labor Department.Bonnie Cash / Getty Images\n",
      "2. Stay Connected\n",
      "3. Sean Michael Newhouse\n",
      "4. A pair of President Donald Trump’s picks for agency inspectors general — Anthony D’Esposito for Labor and Cheryl Mason at the Veterans Affairs Department — have faced inquiries during their confirmation hearings in recent weeks from senators concerned about their ability to act independently from the administration.\n",
      "5. The pair are vying to replace former Labor and VA IGs, who, along with more than a dozen other agency watchdogs who investigate waste, fraud and abuse, werefired by Trumpthe first week of his second term. At the time, the president said: “I don’t know [the IGs]…but some people thought that some were unfair, some were not doing their job.”\n",
      "6. Both D’Esposito and Mason, testifying weeks apart, faced scrutiny due to their political support for the president and past roles working under Trump-appointed department secretaries.\n",
      "7. D’Esposito, a former New York Republican congressman, touted his law enforcement experience Wednesday during a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing and swore to visit every IG regional office.\n",
      "8. “I will travel to each of the regional offices and hear from the men and women on the ground to find out what is actually happening [and] what we can do better,” he said. “Quite frankly, I think they need to feel that they're heard and that they're believed in, and that would make it a more efficient and more productive inspector general's office.”\n",
      "9. D’Esposito also said that he would prioritize working with local police to combat child labor law violations, particularly as they relate to illegal immigration.\n",
      "10. Committee Chair Bill Cassidy, R-La., told D’Esposito that he had a “great background” for the role, but Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., said it was “concerning” that he wouldn’t commit to continuing open investigations that were initiated by the previous Labor IG without seeing them first.\n",
      "11. If confirmed, D’Esposito said he would lead the Labor IG office “without fear or favor.” Throughout the hearing, he said that this is a “golden age of the American worker,” which is a Trump slogan — although he argued that it is nonpartisan.\n",
      "12. Senators did not ask D'Esposito about past controversies, including a2024 report fromThe New York Timesthat he may have violated House ethics rules by allegedly hiring his fiancee’s daughter as well as a woman with whom he was alleged to have had an affair.\n",
      "13. Democrats on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee criticized Mason during her June 4 hearing for her previous role as a senior advisor to VA Secretary Doug Collins, with ranking member Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., asserting the position made Mason unsuitable for a role providing oversight of the department.\n",
      "14. “You have been earning your pay as a loyal advisor, a member of the Collins team, an employee at his behest, a political appointee, not as a career civil servant,” Blumenthal said. “You are a political appointee as inspector general and that is why I will object to your nomination.”\n",
      "15. Mason cited her 28 years of experience at the VA, including as chair of the Board of Veterans Appeals during Trump’s first term, and said her work as a senior advisor to Collins would align with her work as an IG.\n",
      "16. “The senior advisor role was to convey, gather information much like a fact finder does and convey that information to the secretary and to other senior leaders,” she said. “So it's very — it correlates well to the inspector general. The difference is the inspector general has teeth and that is very much what is needed in the department.”\n",
      "17. Mason also flummoxed Blumenthal when she said that she wasn’t involved in any decisions or actions at the VA since Trump’s inauguration.\n",
      "18. “As a senior advisor, I’m not involved in any decisions,” she said, later adding “My role was to gather information and convey that information back.”\n",
      "19. “I can't believe that you are telling us that you haven't been involved in a single action or decision as an advisor,” Blumenthal replied.\n",
      "20. Democrats also questioned Mason’s assertion that she does not have a “close” relationship with Collins.\n",
      "21. Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, who caucuses with the Democrats, recalled that Mason, while visiting his office, remarked after seeing a Coke machine that “the secretary is a Coke guy.” Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who previously served as an assistant secretary in the VA, seized on the fact that Mason’s office was in the secretary’s suite.\n",
      "22. “I know exactly what the inner sanctum of the secretary's office looks like and if you're behind those doors, you're in the inner sanctum, you're not just floating out there,” Duckworth said. “So you probably saw him a lot more than you are trying to lead us to believe.”\n",
      "23. Mason said that she would prioritize implementing more than 500 open recommendations from the VA IG. She denied being involved in themass firings of VA employees,plans to downsize the department workforce by around 80,000 employeesorrequiring workers to sign non-disclosure agreements.\n",
      "24. She was, however, behind a policy that prohibitedVeterans Benefits Administration employees from contacting the VA Office of General Counselwithout her approval.\n",
      "25. Mason committed to recusing herself from investigations of matters that she previously worked on at the VA.\n",

      "4. A Rhode Island federal judge seemed likely Wednesday to block the Transportation Department’s move to yank billions in congressional funding for bridges, roads and airport projects if Democrat-led states do not partake in federal immigration enforcement.\n",
      "5. U.S. District Judge John James McConnell Jr. during a hearing pressed acting U.S. Attorney Sara Miron Bloom on how the Transportation Department could have power over funding that was approved by Congress, saying federal agencies “only have appropriations power given by Congress.”\n",
      "6. “That's how the Constitution works,” he said. “Where does the secretary get the power and authority to impose immigration conditions on transportation funding?”\n",
      "7. The suit brought by 20 Democratic state attorneys general challenges anApril directivefrom Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, a former House member from Wisconsin, that requires states to cooperate in federal immigration enforcement in order to receive federal grants already approved by Congress.\n",
      "8. “Defendents seek to hold hostage tens of billions of dollars of critical transportation funding in order to force the plaintiff states to become mere arms of the federal government's immigration enforcement policies,” Delbert Tran of the California Department of Justice, who argued on behalf of the states, said.\n",
      "9. Arguing on behalf of the Trump administration, Bloom said that Duffy’s letter simply directs the states to follow federal immigration law.\n",
      "10. McConnell, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2011, said that while the states could interpret it that way, the Trump administration has gone after so-called sanctuary cities and targeted them for not taking the same aggressive immigration enforcement as the administration.\n",
      "11. The judge said Bloom’s argument expressed a “very different” interpretation of the directive than how the administration has described it publicly. He also noted President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have “railed on … the issues that arise from sanctuary cities.”\n",
      "12. Trump this weekdirected U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to target Chicago, Los Angeles and New York — three major Democrat-led cities that have policies to not aid in immigration enforcement.\n",
      "13. McConnell said he would make a decision whether to issue a preliminary injunction before Friday. The preliminary injunction would be tailored to the states that brought the suit and would not have a nationwide effect.\n",
      "14. The states that brought the suit are California, Illinois, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Maryland, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.\n",
      "15. Tran said the Department of Transportation’s directive is not only arbitrary and capricious, but undermines congressional authority because Congress appropriated more than $100 billion for transportation projects to the states.\n",
      "16. Cutting off funding would have disastrous consequences, the states have argued.\n",
      "17. “More cars, planes, and trains will crash, and more people will die as a result, if Defendants cut off federal funding to Plaintiff States,”according to the brief from the states.\n",
      "18. Bloom defended Duffy’s letter, saying it listed actions that would impede federal law enforcement and justified withholding of funds because “such actions compromise the safety and security of the transportation systems supported by DOT financial assistance.”\n",
      "19. McConnell said that didn’t answer his question about the secretary’s authority to withhold congressionally appropriated funding.\n",
      "20. “It seems to me that the secretary is saying that a failure to comply with immigration conditions is relevant to the safety and security of the transportation system,” Bloom said.\n",
      "21. McConnell seemed skeptical of that argument.\n",
      "22. “Under that rationale, does the secretary of the Department of Transportation have the authority to impose a condition on federal highway funds that prohibit a state that has legalized abortion from seeking a federal grant?” he asked.\n",
      "23. Bloom said that question was beyond her directive from the Department of Transportation to address in her arguments to the court.\n",
      "24. “I understand your question,” she said. “All I think I can say is that here the secretary has, in his statement, set out a rationale for why this is relevant to DOT funding.”\n",
      "25. Tran said that the “crux of this case is” that the Trump administration is trying “to enforce other laws that do not apply to these grants,” by requiring states to partake in immigration enforcement.\n",

      "1. In nearly 200 submissions NPS received in the first days since feedback solicitations were posted, visitors implored the Trump administration not to erase U.S. history and praised agency staff for improving their experiences.Education Images / Getty Images\n",

      "4. Updated June 19 at 2:30 p.m.\n",
      "5. The Trump administration recently began posting signs on federal parks and historic sites asking for help from visitors in identifying language that negatively discussed America’s past or present and launched a process for federal agencies to remove, cover or replace flagged materials.\n",
      "6. In the responses submitted by visitors to National Park Service sites, however, which were obtained byGovernment Executive, no single submission pointed to any such examples. Instead, in the nearly 200 submissions NPS received in the first days since the solicitations were posted, visitors implored the administration not to erase U.S. history and praised agency staff for improving their experiences.\n",
      "7. The new request at NPS and other Interior Department sites followed an executive order from President Trump dubbed “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History” that called for federal lands to remove information that could “improperly minimize or disparage certain historical figures or events.” That in turn led to an order from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum that department staff solicit public feedback to flag “any signs or other information that are negative about either past or living Americans or that fail to emphasize the beauty, grandeur, and abundance of landscapes and other natural features.” The reviews should include exhibits, brochures, films, waysides and signs, the secretary said.\n",
      "8. In instructions to staff also obtained byGovernment Executive, NPS employees were told to review feedback from visitors weekly but not yet remove any materials. For each comment, staff can either mark it as received but not requiring action, requiring action but not related to the signage issue or flagged for review by NPS leadership in Washington. Parks will receive follow up information in August.\n",
      "9. In the meantime, NPS said, the agency’s Harpers Ferry Center is currently “developing standard protocols and templates to assist with expedited removal, covering, or temporary replacement of any media that does not comply with” Burgum's order. It added a “long-term plan for permanent replacement is also under development for affected media.”\n",
      "10. So far, NPS is not getting the help it was hoping for from those scanning the QR codes now posted around park sites soliciting assistance in identifying language in violation of Trump and Burgum’s orders. Instead, visitors accused the Trump administration of seeking to erase the nation’s history.\n",
      "11. “There shouldn't be signs about history that whitewash and erase the centuries of discrimination against the people who have cared for this land for generations,” a visitor to Indian Dunes National Park said.\n",
      "12. A visitor to Independence Hall in Philadelphia called the new signs “censorship dressed up as customer service.”\n",
      "13. “What upset me the most about the museum—more than anything in the actual exhibits—were the signs telling people to report anything they thought was negative about Americans,” the visitor said. “That isn't just frustrating, it's outrageous. It felt like an open invitation to police and attack historians for simply doing their jobs: telling the truth.”\n",
      "14. Several visitors to the Stonewall National Monument in New York lamented changes there the park’s website that removed mention of transgender individuals in the Stonewall Uprising.\n",
      "15. “Put them back,” the visitor said. “Honor them. There would be no Stonewall without trans people.”\n",
      "16. A visitor at Yellowstone National Park said the information presented there should challenge people.\n",
      "17. “The executive order to asking for feedback is ****,” the message read. “Parks already do an amazing job telling stories that contain hard truths and everyone is entitled to the truth to make better decisions in our lives. So what if people feel bad?”\n",
      "18. Without factual information, the person added, “everything is just a pretty facade with no real substance.”\n",
      "19. At Manzanar National Historical Site, one of the internment camps that held Japanese immigrants and Japanese-Americans during World War II, a visitor said the site existed to present information about the costly errors in U.S. history.\n",
      "20. “The entire purpose of parks like this one is to learn from the mistakes of the past so we can avoid repeating them,” the visitor said. “Please do not water down the reality of the experience for future visitors.”\n",
      "21. A visitor at the Natchez National Historical Park had a similar takeaway.\n",
      "22. “Slavery was a dark time in our history and we need to come to terms with that,” the individual said, “not gloss it over and romanticize the Antebellum South.”\n",
      "23. Only one visitor—at Petersburg National Battlefield, a Civil War site—noted they read signs that “didn’t sit right,” though the individual did not specify any materials that needed changing. Instead, the person requested a “second look” to potentially identify “more balance.” A Grand Canyon National Park visitor said the site should change its signs, but added “signed, Elon,” suggesting the comment was left in jest.\n",
      "24. Many of the comments asked NPS to include more information that highlighted the U.S. government’s discriminatory practices toward Native Americans. A bevy of visitors also asked for increased staffing and complimented the steps existing employees took to improve their experiences.\n",
      "25. Theresa Pierno, president of the National Parks Conservation Association, called the directive requiring park staff to post the new signs with accompanying QR codes “an outrage” that shows the “deep contempt for their work to preserve and tell American stories.”\n",
      "26. “If our country erases the darker chapters of our history, we will never learn from our mistakes,” Pierno said. “These signs must come down immediately.”\n",
      "27. An Interior Department spokesperson said in response to a request for comment that leaks “will not be tolerated.”\n",
      "28. “It is a true shame that employees are spending their time leaking to the media instead of doing work for the American people, the spokesperson said. “The same American people who fund their paychecks.”\n",
      "29. Trump, in his executive order, said federal lands should display materials that amplify American greatness.\n",
      "30. Park materials should “focus on the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people or, with respect to natural features, the beauty, abundance, and grandeur of the American landscape,” Trump said.\n",
      "31. The Independence Hall visitor suggested that line of thinking would not effect the desired result.\n",
      "32. “Putting up signs like that doesn't protect anyone, [it] just tells visitors that the truth is a problem,” the visitor said. “And I can't think of anything more offensive than that.”\n",

      "=== EEOC nominee would likely lead ‘real retreat’ from agency’s civil rights mission ===\n",
      "1. Andrea Lucas has served on the commission since 2020, when President Donald Trump nominated her during his first term.EEOC\n",
      "2. Stay Connected\n",
      "3. Amanda Becker,The 19th\n",
      "4. When a U.S. Senate panel holds a confirmation hearing on Wednesday for Andrea Lucas to lead the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the agency’s former leaders say they will be paying close attention to what she says about EEOC guidance related to pregnancy discrimination and gender identity harassment.\n",
      "5. Lucas has served on the commission since 2020, when President Donald Trump nominated her during his first term. In January, he named her acting chair after firing two of three Democrats serving on the five-member commission before their terms ended — afirst by a president in the agency’s 60-year history.\n",
      "6. With only two of five commissioners remaining, the EEOC has not had the necessary quorum to implement meaningful policy directives during Lucas’ interim tenure. Even still, agency observers said, Lucas, who is expected to be confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate, has repeatedly indicated that she plans to make it more difficult for pregnant and gender-diverse people to bring civil rights claims related to their employment.\n",
      "7. EEOC cases involving trans plaintiffs are already at a standstill, whether their harassment claims are related to their gender identities or not, those familiar with the agency’s caseload told The 19th. Lucas wants to revisit regulations related to enforcement of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act that werefinalized one year ago today. She has also played a prominent role in the president’s efforts to quash diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, or DEI, in workplaces, sending anunprecedented letter to law firmsthat countered agency procedure. In apublic statementreleased in late May, Lucas said part of the EEOC’s commitment to enforcing Trump’s DEI orders means backing away from cases related to “neutral employment policy or practice” that has “an unequal outcome on employees of a particular race of sex.”\n",
      "8. Maya Raghu, a senior adviser to a Democratic EEOC commissioner during the Biden administration, called these cases, known as disparate impact-claims, a “powerful tool that helps uncover and remedy discrimination that isn't explicit and ensures that everyone has a fair chance to succeed.”\n",
      "9. Disparate impact cases are often associated with remedying structural racial discrimination but can also be related to sex, gender and disability. The EEOC only hadone open disparate impact case, brought in 2024, challenging hiring policies at Sheetz. The gas station chain screened applicants for criminal convictions, and the agency brought a case due to the disparate impact it had on Black and Indigenous applicants. The EEOC earlier this monthmoved to dismiss the case, citing Trump’s DEI orders. A worker plaintiff hassought private legal counselto continue the case.\n",
      "10. “Eliminating disparate impact cases, or de-prioritizing them, as this administration is saying, would really take us back to a time when employers could impose policies that unfairly deny opportunities to people of color, women, older Americans and other historically excluded groups without really having to provide a business necessity for the policies,” said Raghu, who is now at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law directing a project on advancing diversity, equity and inclusion.\n",
      "11. Lucas has also signaled her disapproval of long awaitedanti-harassment guidance that the EEOC approved in April 2024, following the Supreme Court’s 2020 decision in Bostock v. Clayton County. It clarified how the agency would enforce workplace harassment related to “race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetic information.” Lucas voted against it andissued a dissentfocused on gender identity, writing that “women’s sex-based rights in the workplace are under attack — and from the EEOC, the very federal agency charged with protecting women from sexual harassment and sex-based discrimination at work.”\n",
      "12. Lucas argued that the position taken by the EEOC in the guidance that denying workers access to bathrooms that matched their gender identities or the intentional use of the wrong pronouns could constitute harassment “impinges on women’s (and indeed, all employees’) rights to freedom of speech and belief.” “Biological sex is real, and it matters. Sex is binary (male and female) and is immutable,” she wrote in the dissent.\n",
      "13. If Lucas is confirmed, and once a quorum is established, the agency is expected to revisit the harassment guidance. She has alreadydrafted and released changesshe would like to see, removing mentions of gender identity. Further, the agency went through its open cases and paused many brought by trans plaintiffs, even when their claims involved harassment unrelated to their gender identity, like disability or race, according to multiple people familiar with the agency’s work.\n",
      "14. A federal judge in Texas last month vacated sections of the harassment guidance related to gender identity but the Supreme Court’s 2020 decision in Bostock remains law and the decision is limited in its application.\n",
      "15. Former EEOC Commissioner Chai Feldblum, who served from 2010 to 2019, said there are “two problems going on at the EEOC right now” related to gender identity.\n",
      "16. “One is if you have a gender-identity claim, our understanding is that they're not necessarily immediately dismissing those — although I'm sure they're doing that with a number of them — but they're just putting it in black holes and not doing anything,” Feldblum explained. “But it’s also being over applied in offices around the country so that even if a transgender person comes in with a disability claim, or they come in with a sexual harassment charge not related to their gender identity, their charge is not being done.”\n",
      "17. “Transgender people are being adversely affected, both with regard to gender identity claims and with regard to unrelated claims,” said Feldblum, who earlier this yearco-founded the EEO Leadership Group. Feldblum said she initially got the group of former EEOC leaders together to see if they could help represent transgender plaintiffs whose cases were languishing. Ahead of Lucas’ hearing this week, theyreleased a letterresponding to her revised harassment guidance.\n",
      "18. EEO Leadership Group members said another aspect of the agency’s work that they expect to come up during Lucas’ hearing that would disproportionately affect women is her desire to revisit the guidance related to pregnant workers issued last year.\n",
      "19. Lucas also voted against that final rule and released a16-page dissent. She wrote that while she supported “elements,” she believed the rule established “new accommodation requirements to reach virtually every condition, circumstance, or procedure that relates to any aspect of the female reproductive system.”\n",
      "20. While Lucas’ desire to revisit the pregnancy guidance is rooted in her opposition to abortion and related workforce accommodations, “once they reopen it, they can make any changes that a majority agrees on,” noted Karla Gilbride, who was general counsel at the EEOC until February, when she joined the public interest law firm Public Citizen. Gilbride is also a member of the EEO Leadership Group.\n",
      "21. Jenny Yang, another former EEOC commissioner and member of the leadership group who now is a partner at the law from Outten & Golden, said that Lucas’ public positions, when combined with her focus on Trump’s DEI efforts and her letter to law firms, indicate that under her leadership, the EEOC would operate very differently than it has in the past.\n",
      "22. “Unfortunately, it does appear that Lucas’ priorities are a real retreat from the historic mission of the agency,” Yang said. “I think that she is demonstrating that she's a full participant in this administration's effort to intimidate employers from engaging in fully lawful efforts to prevent discrimination.”\n",

      "=== New pay claims for active-duty federal employees possible after Supreme Court decision ===\n",
      "1. The Supreme Court has ruled that federal employees serving as military reservists during a national emergency are entitled differential pay, regardless of whether the service was substantially connected to the emergency in question.Thanasis / Getty Images\n",
      "2. Stay Connected\n",
      "3. Carten Cordell\n",
      "4. A recent ruling by the Supreme Court could mean a new rash of pay claims for federal employees who may also serve as military reservists.\n",
      "5. The court ruled on April 30 in itsFeliciano v. Department of Transportation decisionthat military reservists called up to active duty during a national emergency are entitled to the difference between their military and civilian salaries regardless of whether that service was substantially connected to the emergency in question.\n",
      "6. That means federal employees that also serve as military reservists may have new claims on differential pay based on their past active duty service, and the Merit Systems Protection Board, which handles the claims, may soon have more work.\n",
      "7. “Differential pay is codified and provided for for federal employees that are impacted and called to active duty,” said Michael Macomber, partner and CEO at Tully Rinckey PLLC, a national law firm with an extensive government services practice. “What ultimately the Supreme Court found here, it is making it easier for reservists who are impacted who want to file claims to prove that they were, in fact, impacted.”\n",
      "8. The decision stems from a lawsuit filed by Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controller Nick Feliciano, who also served as a Coast Guard reserve petty officer. Feliciano was called up in July 2012 and remained on active duty until February 2017, “serving aboard a Coast Guard ship escorting vessels to and from harbor” that had supported Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, noting that his orders in support of several contingency operations.\n",
      "9. The MSPB rejected Feliciano’s claims for differential pay during his service and he appealed to the Federal Circuit, which also ruled against him, citing “he must show not only that he served while a national emergency was ongoing, but also that a substantive connection linked his service to a particular national emergency.”\n",
      "10. But the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that Feliciano did not need to establish that his service was substantially connected to a national emergency because it was supporting contingency operations.\n",
      "11. Macomber said since the decision, Tully Rinckey has received “dozens if not hundreds of inquiries from federal employees about their eligibility for such claims, given that the law firm has worked with feds in the past to obtain the documentation needed to assert such claims.\n",

      "TITLE: With DeJoy out, postal stakeholders push for pause in criticized Delivering for America overhaul plan\n",
      "AUTHOR: Sean Michael Newhouse\n",
      "CONTENT: As a new leader takes the helm of the U.S. Postal Service, a House panel on Tuesday debated the future of the independent entity. While no member of Congress or expert witness offered a new comprehensive vision, there was near universal consensus on pausing and even reversing the recent reforms of former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy. DeJoy’s 10-year plan to promote the financial sustainability of USPS, dubbed Delivering for America, started in 2021 and aimed atslowing some delivery but generate savings. Specifically, it required mail to sit overnight at post offices instead of being collected each evening to be transported to a processing center and sought to consolidate processing plants into 60 regional distribution centers. Additionally, stamp prices haveincreased six timessince the start of DeJoy’s tenure and that amount is set to rise again in July to 78 cents. These overhauls, however, did not generate revenue.USPS lost $9.5 billion in fiscal 2024and experienceda net loss of $3.3 billionfor the most recent quarter. “Under the Delivering for America plan, our members have suffered unprecedented rate increases and service degradation as the postal service records staggering losses and squanders mailer-funded capital on excess package and processing capacity,” said Mike Plunkett, the CEO and president of the Association for Postal Commerce, which represents businesses that use the mail. “If the incoming PMG is to have any chance at success, the postal service must immediately pause implementation of Delivering for America.” Specifically, Plunkett called for a moratorium on rate increases, a pause in spending on building new facilities and halting any product changes while new leadership assesses what reforms to keep, modify or unwind. Likewise, Jim Cochrane, the CEO of the Package Shippers Association, a trade organization, testified that USPS needs a “new vision” to improve its finances. “The Delivering for America plan has created a widespread degradation of package delivery service performance,” he said. “The changes, unfortunately, disproportionately affect rural communities and those in remote areas of the country.” Cochrane touted public-private partnerships, particularly for the “middle mile” when mail is transported between processing facilities. Criticizing Delivering for Americahas been a bipartisan trendand that continued Tuesday. Paul Steidler of the Lexington Institute and Thomas Schatz of Citizens Against Government Waste, both of which are conservative think tanks, argued for a pause in the overhaul plan. And the top Democrat on the Government Operations Subcommittee alluded to it in his opening remarks. “A lot of people have been asking me ‘Why are we paying more money for the same service?’” said ranking member Kweisi Mfume, D-Md. “And some cynically say ‘Why are we paying more money for an even worse service?’” The bipartisan USPS board of governors selectedDavid Steiner,a longtime CEO of Waste Management and FedEx board member, to be the next postmaster general. DeJoy in March was pressured to resign due to conflicts with the Department of Government Efficiency,according toThe Washington Post. The postal board has been generally supportive of Delivering for America, contending that it is necessary to modernize USPS.

      "TITLE: How shrinking the EPA could make wildfire smoke even more dangerous\n",
      "AUTHOR: Grist\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "1. For weeks, smoke from Canadian wildfires has poured down into the United States, drifting clear across the Atlantic into Europe . Pulmonologist Vivek Balasubramaniam, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, noticed more people calling in with asthma symptoms and asking for advice when smoke doused the region in early June.\n",
      "2. “Walking outside those days, I mean, you could see the brown-orange discoloration to the air,” he said. “When you’re breathing in, you kind of feel like the air is a little heavier, a little harder to do things.”\n",
      "3. Monitoring air quality is key to forecasting and assessing wildfire smoke. Right now, that’s a coordinated effort between federal, state, tribal, and local entities. Federally approved and privately operated monitors feed data into tools like the Environmental Protection Agency’s AirNow tool, and help forecast air quality and issue public health guidance. But air quality scientists worry that EPA budget and job cuts will make it difficult to get air quality information to people, endangering public health. And when it comes to longer-term research, some experts say community monitors won’t fill in the gap.\n",
      "4. The Trump administration announced plans last month to reorganize the agency and cut staff back to levels last seen in the Reagan era, which could mean the elimination of thousands of jobs. The EPA’s proposed budget for 2026 would halve its funding , from $9.14 billion to $4.16 billion.\n",
      "5. “This is really disappointing,” said Christi Chester-Schroeder, lead air quality scientist at IQAir, a free platform. “And honestly, it is sort of antithetical, in the sense that the healthcare costs associated with breathing poor quality error are really significant globally.”\n",
      "6. Along with proposed cuts to grants for state and local air quality management and pollution control, the EPA is planning to restructure how it regulates air quality, dismantl ing two offices charged with regulating air and climate pollution and running such programs: the Office of Atmospheric Protection and the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards.\n",
      "7. The EPA plans to create two new offices to clear a backlog of state plans to meet national air quality standards. A spokesperson said in an email that the new Office of State Air Partnerships would “improve coordination with state, local, and tribal air permitting agencies” to “resolve permitting concerns more efficiently and ensure EPA is working with states, not against them, to advance our shared mission.” The Office of Clean Air Programs would “align statutory obligations and essential functions with centers of expertise to create greater transparency in our regulatory work.”\n",
      "8. Pushback on staffing and funding cuts has been constant. A U.S. District Court judge in Maryland ruled last week that the agency’s termination of $600 million in grants to help communities address pollution was unlawful. And the largest federal workers union was part of a coalition that sued this spring to halt cuts. A federal judge ruled in their favor in May, blocking new layoff and reorganization notices.\n",
      "9. “EPA is complying with the court’s preliminary injunction,” said an EPA spokesperson of the lawsuit in an email. “In line with the court’s order and guidance received by the Department of Justice, EPA is moving forward with only reorganization planning activities.”\n",
      "10. But the agency has already been hamstrung, according to Cathleen Kelly, a senior fellow at the left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress, who said that eliminating the current air monitoring offices would harm research and public health — even if some of their components are preserved elsewhere.\n",
      "11. “It will leave communities more vulnerable when wildfire smoke makes the air unhealthy to breathe, for example, or when corporate polluters release unlawful amounts of pollution and on bad air quality days that increase asthma attacks and land kids and adults that are struggling to breathe in the hospital,” she said.\n",
      "12. Overall, air quality in the U.S. has improved in the decades since the Clean Air Act was enacted in 1970 and began more strictly regulating industrial pollution. The EPA’s own sophisticated monitors have been able to track changes over time, confirming how effective air quality regulations are.\n",
      "13. That progress has been curtailed as wildfire smoke has become more prevalent , and even one bad wildfire season can put the health of communities at risk, with Indigenous nations, low-income communities, and communities of color disproportionately affected. The American Lung Association says nearly half of Americans live with unhealthy levels of air pollution, and that wildfire smoke is a major factor. It can spread far from its source, affecting urban areas that are already dealing with pollution from industry and transportation as well as rural communities with less monitoring because they have fewer people.\n",
      "14. As the EPA seeks to cut jobs, some experts worry there won’t be the staff — or the institutional expertise — to process and distribute that data even if air quality monitors continue to collect readings. And as the EPA guts environmental regulations, like rolling back clean air rules for power plants , it may be harder for scientists to properly assess impacts to public health.\n",
      "15. “That’s, to me, the most concerning consequence,” said Tarik Benmarhnia, a professor of environmental epidemiology at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography who studies wildfire smoke.\n",
      "16. The main hazard in wildfire smoke is PM 2.5, or particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns (a millionth of a meter). This is bad for anyone to breathe, but especially hazardous for those with asthma or heart conditions. As wildfire smoke travels through the atmosphere, it also changes chemically to produce the toxic gas ozone, making breathing the stuff even more hazardous.\n",
      "17. Canadian scientists are also worried that the fires are burning across soils heavily polluted by mining operations , so the smoke could be laced with toxicants like arsenic and lead.\n",
      "18. As climate change exacerbates droughts and raises temperatures — which sucks up the moisture in vegetation — more landscapes are burning and loading the atmosphere with smoke. Recent research has shown that the human health impact of PM 2.5 from wildfire smoke can be up to 10 times higher than other sources of particulate matter, said Benmarhnia. A study published last month in the journal Communications Earth and Environment found that between 2006 and 2020, climate change contributed to 15,000 deaths due to particulate matter from wildfire smoke.\n",
      "19. To understand how wildfire smoke is affecting people’s health and warn them of its dangers, it needs to be measured. Places like the Great Lakes that aren’t used to dealing with wildfires and their fallout are just now solidifying public health awareness campaigns.\n",
      "20. “The first statewide air quality alert for fine particulate matter from wildfire smoke was in 2023,” said Aaron Ferguson, who manages the Climate and Tracking Unit at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. “That’s really when we first started developing a lot of our public health guidance and response strategies.”\n",
      "21. That work relies in part on more than 40 air quality stations run by the state through EPA grants that are still in place for now.\n",
      "22. Increasingly, federal air quality monitors have been supplemented by private companies and community monitoring efforts, including among tribal nations, rural areas and places federal and state governments have neglected. Free services like PurpleAir and IQAir provide hyper-local air quality readings for people to determine if they need to shelter from wildfire smoke.\n",
      "23. “What people are using this for is to decide when to let the kids out with asthma, or when to go cycling if they’re an athlete,” said Adrian Dybwad, CEO and founder of PurpleAir.\n",
      "24. Pierce Mayville, the air quality scientist for the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, said those monitors are “huge” when it comes to getting people usable, practical information, providing near-real-time information about air quality. They have one and are setting up another.\n",
      "25. “If we see the level really high in the purple, then we let people know,” Mayville said. “People can look at the map and see a live-time view of what’s going on so they can keep track of the air quality in their area.”\n",
      "26. What Benmarhnia and other scientists need is a steady stream of reliable data, especially from advanced sensors that determine the composition of wildfire smoke, like if it contains heavy metals. Cheaper instruments just measure the amount of PM 2.5 in the air, not what it’s made of. They can then correlate that data with hospital emissions in a given area to get insights into what makes wildfire emissions so deadly.\n",
      "27. “In order to be able to better test these hypotheses, we need these federally funded monitors and networks and data,” Benmarhnia said. “This is critical. Without that, it would be impossible to do this type of research and better understand what is going on.”\n",

      "TITLE: Funding for further EHR deployments ‘vitally important,’ VA secretary says\n",
      "AUTHOR: Edward Graham\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "1. Fully deploying the Department of Veterans Affairs’ new electronic health record system is necessary for streamlining veteran care and retaining clinicians, VA Secretary Doug Collins told members of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies on Tuesday.\n",
      "2. VA first signed a $10 billion contract — later revised to over $16 billion — with Cerner in May 2018 to modernize its legacy health record system and make it interoperable with the Pentagon’s new health record, which was also provided by Cerner. Oracle later acquired Cerner in 2022 and rebranded the new unit as Oracle Health.\n",
      "3. Problems with VA’s EHR software arose, however, almost as soon as it was first rolled out in 2020 at the Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center in Spokane, Washington. Patient safety concerns, performance glitches and usability challenges plagued the system, leading to VA paused the modernization project in April 2023 until it could address problems at the sites where the software had been deployed. As of this month, the new EHR system has been implemented at just six of VA’s 170 medical centers.\n",
      "4. VA announced in December that it was moving out of its operational pause and planned to roll out the new system at four Michigan-based medical sites in mid-2026. Collins subsequently announced in March that the department was planning to deploy the software at nine additional medical facilities next year, bringing the total to 13 sites.\n",
      "5. During Tuesday’s hearing on VA’s fiscal year 2026 budget, Collins told lawmakers that VA’s continued use of its current EHR system — the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture, or VistA — affects the retention of healthcare professionals across the agency’s operations. VistA runs on a programming language called MUMPS that some have argued is outdated.\n",
      "6. “You're using a system that's costing us literally hundreds of millions of dollars, that's used nowhere else in the world except the VA,” Collins said, alluding to VistA. “So we need to move forward on this [modernization effort].”\n",
      "7. He said VA has also worked to streamline engagement with their Oracle Health counterparts and to promote standardization across the sites using the new EHR software and added that “we had about a 10% gap to where VA would have our uniqueness [in coding].”\n",
      "8. Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich. — who noted that four of next year’s planned site rollouts are located in his state — called the EHR modernization project “a complex endeavor” and pressed Collins about how he would ensure that future software deployments are not beset by additional outages, slowdowns and disruptions.\n",
      "9. “That's why the funding for this is so vitally important,” Collins said. “Because I can't emphasize enough, if we do not transform this system, it hurts our community care process because our doctors cannot communicate with the community [or] our doctors internally.”\n",
      "10. The Trump administration’s FY26 budget proposal —released on May 2 — requests $3.5 billion overall for the deployment of the new EHR system, which represents a roughly $2.2 billion boost over the agency’s FY25 ask for the project.\n",
      "11. Collins told lawmakers last month that he hopes successful rollouts of the system next year will lead to faster rollouts moving forward, with a goal of “probably the addition of 20 to 25 more” deployments at medical facilities in fiscal year 2027.\n",
      "12. Last week, VA Deputy Secretary Paul Lawrence touted the progress the agency was already making ahead of next year’s planned rollouts and said deployment activities were already occurring at 11 of the 13 sites. He said VA was planning to begin activities at the two remaining facilities by the end of the month, and that the agency was hoping to fully implement the system at every VA medical facility by 2031.\n",
      "13. Peters noted that surveys conducted during VA’s operational pause showed that efforts to right the modernization project were on track, with the number of system interruptions affecting clinicians decreasing, while veteran trust in the facilities where the system had been deployed was increasing. But he still expressed some concern about plans to restart deployments, given previous problems with the initiative.\n",
      "14. “We do want to have more efficiency, but you have to make sure we don't have undue disruptions,” Peters cautioned.\n",

      "TITLE: Lawmakers spar over DOGE as Republicans look to lock in cuts\n",
      "AUTHOR: Natalie Alms\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "1. Republicans and Democrats traded jabs on Tuesday over the work of the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency during a DOGE subcommittee hearing.\n",
      "2. “We need to lock in DOGE savings for the taxpayers, and we should also be thinking about locking in the DOGE process that has produced these savings,” said Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., the head of the House Committee Oversight and Government Reform’s DOGE subcommittee, saying that the government is like an “overgrown, out-of-control animal.”\n",
      "3. Trump set up DOGE on his first day in office with a purported focus on tech, cost savings and efficiency, although since then the group’s efforts have been wide-ranging, including effectively shutting down entire agencies. Cost savings from the effort have fallen far short of Musk’s trillion-dollar goal, and DOGE’s public tally of cost savings has been riddled with errors. Critics say the unit's work has actually made many government processes less efficient.\n",
      "4. Billionaire Elon Musk stepped back from DOGE weeks ago, but the office’s associates remain dispersed across agencies. The administration is also seeking $45 million in funding for DOGE next year.\n",
      "5. “To win this war, we need to make sure these cuts aren’t just temporary,” said Greene. “That means passing laws to streamline agencies, eliminate redundant programs and give the president the authority to fire bureaucrats who don’t do their jobs.”\n",
      "6. Republican lawmakers are trying to push through a $9 billion rescission package that they say is meant to cement DOGE priorities with cuts to foreign aid and public broadcasting. They’re also up against a looming July 4 goal to pass a tax and spending reconciliation package to extend and expand tax cuts and enact priorities like immigration enforcement. Democrats noted that such a package is projected to add to the deficit .\n",
      "7. Democrats pushed back on the premise that DOGE is about efficiencies or savings.\n",
      "8. “All of this talk about lowering costs and reducing waste is absolute BS. Their agenda is about one thing: making the federal government so weak that they can exploit it for their personal gain,” said Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, who tried to subpoena Musk during the hearing. Republicans blocked the request, as they have with previous attempts.\n",
      "9. Greene said that DOGE is working to reduce waste, fraud and abuse. But since January, the Trump administration has fired many inspectors general, whose job it is to fight waste, fraud and abuse in agencies, despite the White House’s purported focus on those issues.\n",
      "10. “We came to the table at the beginning of this whole process in good faith with real ideas, bipartisan ideas, that folks have been working on for years and a desire to actually fix and modernize the federal government, what we've seen from DOGE is the exact opposite,” said the top Democrat on the subcommittee, Rep. Melanie Stansbury, D-N.M.\n",
      "11. “We all agree the government should be more efficient. We all agree that we should cut waste. We all agree that there should be bipartisan pathways forward to make the government operate in a modern manner,” Stansbury added. “But that's not what this enterprise is all about.”\n",
      "12. Some Democrats —and their witness Emily DiVito of the Groundwork Collaborative, an economic policy think tank — pointed to Social Security as an example of the negative impact of DOGE. The Trump administration is pushing to shrink its workforce by thousands, and SSA has been at the center of headlines for customer service problems.\n",
      "13. In May, the agency reversed an anti-fraud policy that slowed down retirement processing after it found essentially no fraud . It was put in place after DOGE and White House leaders repeated false claims about fraud levels on SSA phone lines.\n",
      "14. “[DOGE has] led to poor services, a brain drain on our federal government, and it’s going to cost taxpayers money long term,” said Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Va.\n",

      "TITLE: National Parks scramble to fill top leadership positions, but fix could create more vacancies\n",
      "AUTHOR: Eric Katz\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "1. The National Park Service is scrambling to fill top-level leadership positions at posts throughout the country, launching a new initiative to fill dozens of vacant roles that some inside the agency fear will only create new openings at other sites.\n",
      "2. Dubbed “Operation Opportunity,” NPS is soliciting applications for openings at the superintendent, deputy superintendent and chief of facilities level at a variety of park locations. Due to an ongoing governmentwide hiring freeze, however, the positions are only open to internal applicants within the Interior Department.\n",
      "3. That will limit those qualified for the lateral moves to employees already working in similar roles, according to a source involved in the initiative, meaning anyone who takes one of the jobs would be very likely creating a similar vacancy elsewhere within NPS. The vacancies currently being filled have been deemed high priority positions and are categorized at or among the top ranks of the civil service.\n",
      "4. Among the open positions are the superintendents for the National Parks of Big Bend, Glacier Bay and White Sands, the deputy superintendent for Glacier and Indiana Dunes and the chief of facilities at Yosemite. The list includes top openings at a myriad of additional national historic and other NPS sites, such as Martin Luther King National Historic Park in Atlanta.\n",
      "5. The number of vacancies among the top ranks at parks is expected to grow once those who accepted “deferred resignations”—and are currently sitting on administrative leave through September—are officially off the rolls.\n",
      "6. The source familiar with the initiative voiced concern that due to the nature of the internal postings—Operation Opportunity is open only for “lateral reassignments\"—the only people who would be qualified are those “who are at the level and already have the experience.” If they are accepted into the positions, their existing roles would then become vacant. Operation Opportunity originally launched in April, but agency leadership has “chaotically” asked HR to quickly post the dozens of park leadership positions. The urgency of the directive reflected a newfound pressure to fill the roles, the source said.\n",
      "7. An Interior spokesperson said Government Executive was seeking to \"skew the creation of new job opportunities for the American people.\"\n",
      "8. \"The department is thrilled to be posting and filling new positions at our treasured national parks,\" the spokesperson said. \"This administration is committed to expanding the workforce and investing in our beautiful parks - which are open and ready to visit!\"\n",
      "9. The agency is also dealing with staffing issues at the rank-and-file level. As of last month, the National Parks Conservation Association found NPS staffing was down 13% overall since President Trump took office. It also found that while Burgum pledged to hire as many as 7,700 seasonal employees for the peak summer season, NPS had onboarded just 3,300. That hiring was delayed as seasonal staff were initially subject to the hiring freeze . NPCA found there were around 100 total vacant superintendent positions.\n",
      "10. The source familiar with the initiative noted that seasonal hiring has been hampered by Trump administration policies.\n",
      "11. “Positions which were super easy to fill last year have had bone dry applicant pools and tons of declinations because people are scared to take a federal job,” the source said, or because they “don’t want to work for this administration.”\n",
      "12. The agency is also expected to lay off around 1,500 employees if the Supreme Court allows the Trump administration to move forward with its planned reductions in force, though Burgum has insisted the cuts will not impact park operations and has demanded that no park can reduce its hours or services without headquarters approval.\n",
      "13. During congressional testimony earlier this month, Burgum reiterated to lawmakers that layoffs would not affect parks and said superintendent openings were being filled on a temporary basis.\n",
      "14. “We're trying to cut jobs that aren't in parks,” the secretary said to Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colo. “And if there's a vacancy to superintendent [positions], we fill it with the deputy. So it's incorrect for you to say that we have—we have vacancies because when a superintendent takes early retirement, superintendents are at the end of their career.”\n",
      "15. Theresa Pierno, NPCA’s president, said Burgum was being dishonest in his testimony.\n",
      "16. “Secretary Burgum’s narrative doesn’t match the reality unfolding in our parks,” Pierno said. “The Park Service is in a full-blown staffing crisis.\n",

      "TITLE: Lawmakers demand review of VA’s AI-driven contract cuts\n",
      "AUTHOR: Edward Graham\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "1. Two senators on the panel overseeing the Department of Veterans Affairs are pressing the agency’s inspector general to probe VA’s mass contract cancellations and the role that artificial intelligence played in determining the agreements that would be terminated.\n",
      "2. In a June 13-dated letter to VA Inspector General David Case that was publicly released on Monday, Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Angus King, I-Maine, called for the agency watchdog to review the hundreds of VA contracts cancelled by the Department of Government Efficiency since the start of the Trump administration.\n",
      "3. Blumenthal is the ranking member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, and King is also a member of the committee.\n",
      "4. In line with DOGE’s cost-cutting efforts, VA Secretary Doug Collins has announced that the agency is looking at letting go of as many as 83,000 employees across its operations this year to return to its 2019 staffing levels. Collins similarly announced in March that VA was cancelling “585 non-mission-critical or duplicative contracts,” with plans to cancel additional agreements as the agency continued its review.\n",
      "5. In both instances, Collins stressed that the efforts are designed to streamline VA’s operations and to limit unnecessary spending, and that they would not affect mission-critical programs.\n",
      "6. The lawmakers — who wrote that VA has cancelled over 650 contracts through the end of May — said, however, that a preliminary review of the terminated agreements found that “a majority appear to be for services directly for veterans or critical VA operations to include for safe health care delivery,” and that it also seemed as though the agency did not perform the necessary planning needed before undertaking the mass cancellations.\n",
      "7. They also cited a June 6 ProPublica investigation “that found evidence that DOGE and VA officials used ill-conceived Artificial Intelligence (AI) formulas and algorithms to make or inform contract cancellation decisions — cutting out meaningful input from VA career experts to assess the impact of ending these services.”\n",
      "8. Blumenthal similarly pointed to the news report about the use of AI during a Democrat-only June 10 spotlight forum , saying at the time that he supported cutting waste at VA but that “the way to focus on it is thoughtfully and factually, not to use AI and identify keywords in the contract that then result in wholesale slashing.”\n",
      "9. The two lawmakers said the use of AI to identify contracts for termination “adds an entire new level of unease connected to the decision-making, security, governance, and quality control of the entire process.”\n",
      "10. In an interview with ProPublica, the DOGE employee who created the AI tool that was used to identify contracts for “munching” — or cancellation — at VA told the outlet that “ mistakes were made ” by his program. He also said that analyzing VA’s nearly 90,000 contracts within the 30-day period outlined by President Donald Trump’s February executive order mandating such a review of agencies’ “spending on contracts, grants and loans” would have been impossible without developing the AI tool.\n",
      "11. In addition to pressing the IG to investigate the impact of the cancelled contracts on veterans and VA as a whole, Blumenthal and King also requested that the watchdog look into “the use of AI and/or algorithms to guide decision-making to include the recipient and purpose” of each VA contract identified for termination.\n",
      "12. The lawmakers also asked that the IG review “the formal assignment and instructions given” to the DOGE employee to determine if they included the use of AI, as well as look into whether there were data privacy safeguards in place for the contract information run through the AI tool and “the extent to which this and any other related use of AI by DOGE or the VA violated any policy, procedure, regulation, or statute.”\n",

      "TITLE: From HIV clinics to outer space: Awards program spotlights federal employees in the face of civil service headwinds\n",
      "AUTHOR: Sean Michael Newhouse\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "1. Almost as soon as Dr. Laura Cheever found out that she was being honored for her decades of leadership at the Health and Human Services Department, she thought it was somewhat peculiar to be receiving an individual recognition.\n",
      "2. “When they first called…they said, ‘We want you to talk to us about what you did,” Cheever recalled. “I think that to be successful in government you have to be able to work well in teams and to collaborate and to see possibilities and partnerships.”\n",
      "3. Cheever is one of 23 current and former federal employees who received a 2025 Samuel J. Heyman Service to America medal (Sammie), an awards program that the Partnership for Public Service has sponsored since 2002 for outstanding civil servants. This year, however, the nonpartisan good government group had to contend with the Trump administration’s cuts to agency workforces and efforts to weaken the independence of the civil service.\n",
      "4. “I was really, one, honored to have received an award, and, two, really pleased that they were able to find a way to do it,” Cheever said.\n",
      "5. While she is nearly six months into a “long-planned retirement” that was “not related to elections,” Cheever spent more than two decades leading the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program , which provides medical and other support to low-income people with HIV and annually assists more than half of all people in the U.S. with HIV, estimated at about 500,000 individuals.\n",
      "6. Her involvement with treating HIV began while she was doing medical training in San Francisco in the 1990s. She then moved to Baltimore for similar work during which time medicines started emerging that stopped an HIV diagnosis from automatically meaning a death sentence.\n",
      "7. “I was very interested in making sure that as many people as possible could get started on these medications as quickly as possible,” Cheever said. “I saw that working for the federal government, I would be able to really increase that impact exponentially, and that's why I went to work for the federal government from a position that I loved in academia.”\n",
      "8. At the end of 2024, HHS announced that a record-breaking 90.6% of individuals with HIV receiving medical care through Ryan White were virally suppressed, meaning they are on medication that prevents sexual transmission of the virus. This is a roughly 20% increase from 2010 and higher than the national viral suppression rate of 65%.\n",
      "9. Cheever is worried, however, that proposed cuts to public health care funding in congressional Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act (H.R. 1) and the Trump administration’s anti-LGBTQ+ policies could impede that progress.\n",
      "10. “If Medicaid or Medicare were to drastically be reduced or otherwise cut people off from being able to access care, or people are scared to come to care because they are transgender or gay or whatever those issues are going to be for people in this current environment, that is what makes me very, very concerned about the nation as a whole making progress,” she said.\n",
      "11. She’s also apprehensive about the ability of agencies to bring on top-tier talent in the future.\n",
      "12. “I've recruited many, many very talented people to come into federal government, and I've been able to tell them, quite honestly, that in every administration I've worked in, Democrat, Republican, all sorts of different people, we always had amazing opportunities to pursue our work. We had to shift the work, but our core mission and values really had not changed over time,” she said. “I'm not sure I could tell that to people today.”\n",
      "13. Agency financial, performance report writers get their moment in the spotlight\n",
      "14. Another 2025 honoree — Richard Burns , a project manager at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center — was recognized for leading the team behind OSIRIS-REx, a spacecraft that brought back the largest asteroid sample to Earth.\n",
      "15. Studies on that sample have found molecules that are key to life, suggesting, according to NASA , that “the conditions necessary for the emergence of life were widespread across the early solar system [and] increasing the odds life could have formed on other planets and moons.”\n",
      "16. As such, Burns said he gets a lot of questions about aliens.\n",
      "17. “It’s not unreasonable. One of the points of OSIRIS-REx was to investigate the composition of these primitive asteroids to ascertain whether they contain the ingredients for life,” he said. “It answers key questions in how did life originate.”\n",
      "18. But to reach that discovery, Burns and his team faced a barrage of complications.\n",
      "19. “OSIRIS-REx was really just a series of crises once we got to the asteroid,” he said.\n",
      "20. The asteroid Bennu had an unexpectedly rugged surface, which created difficulties for landing. The spacecraft also collected too much rock, which briefly prevented the lid on its sample collection capsule from closing. And when it returned to Earth, one of its two parachutes didn’t work.\n",
      "21. “The first parachute didn't open. There was a lot of tension in the sample return event,” he said. “The main parachute did open and deployed successfully, and everything was okay in the end because the system was designed robustly.”\n",
      "22. Still, Burns said there were many celebratory “fist in the air moments.”\n",
      "23. “We had lots of moments where we celebrated pretty good, but always knowing the race wasn't won yet,” he said. “Finally, when we got the sample mass we knew that we had accomplished what we had set out to do.”\n",
      "24. Overcoming obstacles, however, is why Burns argues individuals should want to work for NASA.\n",
      "25. “You get to…be part of teams that are very highly capable, motivated and focused on success and contributing to solving some of the hardest problems there are to solve. It is a really rewarding career,” he said. “So that would be the pitch. I hope it's true in the future.”\n",
      "26. Other honorees this year include the State Department team that implemented the first-ever online passport renewal system , National Weather Service employees who developed a seven-day, localized forecast system to gauge heat risk — the top weather-related cause of death in the U.S. — and Kathleen Kirsch of the U.S. Agency for International Development who led U.S. assistance in helping Ukraine maintain its energy infrastructure amid Russia’s invasion.\n",
      "27. Dave Lebryk, formerly of the Treasury Department, was named federal employee of the year . He was responsible for ensuring the disbursement of trillions in government funding before retiring after a clash with Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency over access to the payment system.\n",
      "28. “The stories of these Sammies honorees vividly highlight the kinds of important services, innovations and benefits provided by our government, and are a reminder of what could be lost as a result of the ongoing cutbacks to federal agencies, personnel and programs,” Partnership President and CEO Max Stier said in a statement .\n",
      "29. There were more than 350 nominations across 65 agencies for this year’s Sammies. A ceremony was held on June 17 at the John Hopkins University Bloomberg Center in Washington, D.C.\n",

      "TITLE: Most fed-targeting provisions in Senate reconciliation bill don’t pass Byrd muster\n",
      "AUTHOR: Erich Wagner\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "1. A series of plans targeting federal workers’ retirement benefits, their unions and civil service protections were dealt a setback over the weekend when the Senate parliamentarian warned that they violate rules governing budget reconciliation initiatives.\n",
      "2. Last week, Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Rand Paul, R-Ky., unveiled his panel’s portion of congressional Republicans’ budget reconciliation package, which aims to reduce federal spending to partially pay for extended tax cuts for the ultrawealthy and increased immigration enforcement. The measure abandoned a series of House-passed proposals to cut the retirement benefits of currently serving federal workers but would have required future federal hires to pay nearly 15% of their paychecks toward their retirement benefits if they wished to accrue civil service protections.\n",
      "3. But Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., top Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, announced Sunday that the Senate parliamentarian had ruled that most of the Senate’s proposals governing federal benefits and workforce policies violated the Byrd rule, which aims to limit reconciliation measure—and its simple majority threshold for passage—to topics that are budgetary in nature.\n",
      "4. “There is no better way to define this big beautiful betrayal of a bill than families lose and billionaires win,” he said. “Democrats are on the side of families and workers and are scrutinizing this bill piece by piece to ensure Republicans can’t use the reconciliation process to force their anti-worker policies on the American people. The Byrd Rule is enshrined in law for a reason, and Democrats are making sure it is enforced.”\n",
      "5. Provisions that would require a 60-vote majority to advance include the plan to require all new federal employees to pay 9.4% toward the Federal Employees Retirement System and to choose between paying an additional 5 percentage points toward FERS or serving as at-will employees; a requirement that federal employees challenging an adverse action before the Merit Systems Protection Board pay a $350 filing fee, as well as a proposal to charge federal employee unions for use of agency property and official time on a quarterly basis.\n",
      "6. The parliamentarian also said that a provision effectively giving the Trump administration “carte blanche” to reorganize federal agencies and lay off thousands of federal workers would similarly run afoul of the Byrd rule. Earlier this month, Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters that he would not consider overruling the parliamentarian as part of the bid to send the reconciliation package to President Trump’s desk by July 4.\n",
      "7. Still remaining in the package is a provision tasking the Office of Personnel Management with conducting an audit of enrollees in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program to ensure family members remain eligible as dependents, and a requirement that the government charge a 10% fee on deductions from federal workers paychecks, such as unions dues and charitable contributions as part of the Combined Federal Campaign.\n",
      "8. In a statement, National Treasury Employees Union National President Doreen Greenwald praised the rulings.\n",
      "9. “We are glad the Senate parliamentarian agreed that many of the harmful federal employee provisions contained in the draft budget reconciliation package were not a real attempt to save money, but instead an attempt to use the budget reconciliation process to make significant changes to civil service policies,” she said. “As this process continues to move forward, NTEU will keep up the fight to protect employee pay, benefits and workforce rights from those who are determined to harm frontline federal employees around the country who work hard every day to serve the American people, and to weaken the unions that represent them.”\n",

      "TITLE: OPM’s new performance management rules are (mostly) spot on\n",
      "AUTHOR: Ronald Sanders\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "1. The Office of Personnel Management has just issued detailed new requirements for agency performance management systems, and while I will take issue with some of the details on technical and policy grounds—especially anything that even hints at political partisanship—I think they’re a step in the right direction, especially insofar as they take on things like the perennial problem of inflated, “everybody gets a medal” annual performance ratings.\n",
      "2. Yes, those new rules are incredibly detailed, particularly if they’re intended as the “be all and end all” of federal performance management. As promulgated, they leave little to no room for federal agencies to field systems that are equally rigorous but better reflect their different missions and cultures. Thus, the new rules may be construed as “one size fits all” in that regard. I hope I’m wrong, because if they work as clearly intended—that is, by setting a governmentwide floor for this year’s performance cycle and beyond—they needn’t be.\n",
      "3. More agency realism and the ‘floor’ established by OPM\n",
      "4. If the new standards are intended as “the minimum daily adult requirement” for performance evaluation—one that brings sorely needed rigor and realism to a critical management activity that unfortunately, has lapsed—then they’re a net positive. And I would argue that like a spoonful of castor oil, they’re necessary. Too many agencies have surrendered when it comes to the real burdens and return on investment of performance management, opting to make the process so simple as to become largely irrelevant, a necessary evil required by law, as in, “Okay, if we have to do it, let’s make it as painless as possible.” To me, that looks too much like waving a white flag.\n",
      "5. Take so-called “pass-fail” systems. OPM’s new rules ban them, and that couldn’t come fast enough. Under such systems (and they’ve proliferated), almost no one fails and virtually everyone passes. I don’t know if our civil servants are that good, but I do think that most employees don’t really like pass-fail, as they allow managers to avoid making often-difficult distinctions in employee performance. Even though everyone knows they exist (especially the employees themselves).\n",
      "6. The fact is that employees perform at different levels, the result of a whole host of factors like training, fit, ability, motivation, work habits, distractions at home (and work) and yes, just plain old bureaucracy...inefficiencies that have festered over the years. But that doesn’t mean surrender. Just the opposite!\n",
      "7. Maybe we’ve lapsed because the stakes are so low. When it comes to pay, an employee’s compensation is basically on automatic pilot (even the Government Accountability Office says so!), a function of the time clock and a pulse. Seniority and survival prevail over high performance, at least to date. And while OPM’s new standards attempt to use current law to reward that high performance, the fact is that the decades-old General Schedule was just not built to do so.\n",
      "8. Requiring (often hard) performance distinctions is a good thing\n",
      "9. Or maybe it’s because we don’t invest in and support our managers when they make those difficult distinctions. That too needs to be addressed, but at the agency level. With some exceptions, like the now semi-permanent Acquisition and Lab “Demonstration Projects” in DOD, performance distinctions made by managers have no real consequences, so it’s no wonder that many of them just don’t bother to make those distinctions.\n",
      "10. I don’t blame them—we’ve given them too much to do and not enough training to do it—but at the same time, that doesn’t mean we need to accept that everyone’s performance is the same and should therefore receive the same (typically inflated) rating. That’s just not true and getting real when it comes to annual ratings is worth tackling.\n",
      "11. That also applies to retention, and OPM gets credit for tilting at that windmill too. Today, retention is pretty much automatic. Non-probationary employees almost always get a job for life and then receive as much as a 35% increase in salary—from Step 1 to Step 10 in the GS system—just by virtue of patience, pulse and an “acceptable level of competence” (whatever that means).\n",
      "12. Some (hopefully many) employees may really be motivated by public service and do not care about performance, pay and/or retention distinctions, but my own experience says otherwise.\n",
      "13. Equity theory says performance distinctions matter\n",
      "14. You see, I’m a proponent of ‘equity theory’ when it comes to motivation. It says that one pays close attention to the efforts of one’s co-workers, what they “give” on the job and what they “get” for it in return. It suggests that employees will adjust their efforts up or down to ensure “equity.” But in my cynical experience, if an idealistic, high performing “baby” civil servant sees more seasoned co-workers just punching the time clock, that person will eventually do the same. After all, it’s just not worth the extra effort, at least so says equity theory.\n",
      "15. Of course, I’m generalizing, as workers are motivated by a whole host of things. But the decades-old GS system generalizes too. When its rules explicitly say that time-in-grade matters above all else, many employees will behave that way. That does not mean that they or their peers do not (or did not) have what Jim Perry calls “public service motivation” but the weight of that system, permeating every aspect of one’s working life, may eventually dull if not destroy that intrinsic motivation.\n",
      "16. Among other things, one way to combat that resultant apathy is to focus on performance management, both day-to-day and over time, and OPM’s attempt to control ratings inflation, as well as to ban pass-fail systems, are both good. Not easy. But good. Many of today’s performance appraisal systems just ooze mediocrity. They implicitly (and unintentionally?) encourage and reward it, and while that mediocrity may be okay for some, I think American citizens, as well as most federal civil servants, have soundly rejected that notion.\n",
      "17. Thus, I think employees actually want managers to make performance distinctions (their own, as well as peers’), so long as they’re seen as fair and accurate. Achieving that has always been the challenge, but that’s a problem worth spending some time on. What’s not are pass-fail systems that simply give up and say all employees are alike when it comes to their performance, when everyone knows that they are not.\n",
      "18. We need more accountability, not less\n",
      "19. A quick word about my friend Erich Wagner’s excellent story in Government Executive on this subject, in which an anonymous HR director is quoted as saying the new rules ignore two harsh realities: the current system’s lack of pay consequences, and its impact on RIFs. I agree with that assessment, but in contrast to that unnamed source, I think that impact is a net positive.\n",
      "20. I’ve already talked about the need to make individual performance and pay distinctions matter, but there are problems with the governmentwide system that need fixing too. Thus, while governmentwide pay “comparability” has been a problem for the federal civil service almost since its inception (for example how do you value tangible benefits like pensions?), tackling that problem—perhaps by modernizing the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act—is also something we seem to be avoiding.\n",
      "21. I didn’t do so when I chaired the Federal Salary Council, but my efforts to “reform” that law (and fully fund those government agencies that implement it) largely fell on deaf ears. It’s just too convenient to rail in the media about the seemingly intractable but in my view, mythical “pay gap” between federal and non-federal employees, rather than try to reduce it through methodological fixes like more occupational differentiation (something the labor market does as a matter of course), vs. paying some far more than the market says they deserve...and some far less.\n",
      "22. Erich’s unnamed source also suggested that the new rules will have an impact on RIF. I agree, but for good reasons, not bad. The performance management system should make more performance distinctions when we run a RIF, not less! Indeed, I think performance distinctions, if meaningful, ought to be determinative when an agency retrenches. But like so many other things, that too has become irrelevant. We should want to retain our best, highest performers—not our most senior ones—when we RIF and I hope the “new” OPM encourages agencies to do so.\n",
      "23. Bottom line: Give OPM an ‘A’ for effort...but with some caveats\n",
      "24. The bottom line here is that OPM’s new standards are pretty good, especially if you 1. shed any hint of political partisanship—we haven’t talked about that, but I’d refer you to Erich’s article, as it does a good job of pointing those out in order to preserve a nonpartisan civil service—2. back off of any plug for forced ratings distribution, in favor of more realism and—3. allow for more stringent, agency-based systems that better reflect government’s variety of missions and measures.\n",
      "25. But as I said above, I’m old school in that regard, as well as a naively optimistic “glass half full” person, and I will always argue that we should keep and reward our very best civil servants, even if that’s hard! So, the new OPM rules, especially if clarified as I hope, are a step in the right direction. Now, if only there are people still willing to come work for the federal government, after all the DOGE carnage and talk about “throat slashing.” But that’s another matter.\n",

      "TITLE: DHS expects Iran’s cyber forces will target US networks after strikes on nuclear sites\n",
      "AUTHOR: David DiMolfetta\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "1. Iran-linked hackers and other groups affiliated with Tehran will likely launch cyberattacks against U.S. targets in response to President Donald Trump’s order to strike three of Iran’s nuclear sites, according to a Department of Homeland Security bulletin issued Sunday.\n",
      "2. “Low-level cyber attacks against U.S. networks by pro-Iranian hacktivists are likely, and cyber actors affiliated with the Iranian government may conduct attacks against U.S. networks,” said the alert from the National Terrorism Advisory System.\n",
      "3. The notice, scheduled to expire Sept. 22, adds that “hacktivists and Iranian government-affiliated actors routinely target poorly secured U.S. networks and internet-connected devices for disruptive cyber attacks.”\n",
      "4. Under orders from Trump, U.S. bombers struck the Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan nuclear facilities in Iran on Saturday night, escalating a yearslong tension between the two nations that occurred amid back and forth talks seeking to deter Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Just over a week ago, Israel launched its own incursion against Iranian military officials and scientists, on grounds that Iran was closer than ever before to having nuclear weapon capabilities.\n",
      "5. The aim of the strikes was to destroy “Iran’s nuclear enrichment capacity” and eliminate “the nuclear threat posed by the world’s No. 1 state sponsor of terror,” Trump said Saturday night. “The strikes were a spectacular military success.”\n",
      "6. The NTAS bulletin reflects years of observed Iranian cyberattacks targeting U.S. systems. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’s Cyber-Electronic Command and the affiliated “Cyber Av3ngers” gang were found to have breached U.S. water infrastructure in late 2023 in response to Israel’s war against Hamas.\n",
      "7. During the 2024 election cycle, the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency concluded that Iran stole sensitive documents from the Trump campaign and floated them to the media with the hope that they’d be published online.\n",
      "8. Iranian hackers tend to launch distributed denial of service attacks — designed to overwhelm a webpage with bot traffic until the page crashes — against aerospace, oil, gas and telecommunications entities, Brian Harrell, a former DHS assistant secretary who served in Trump’s first term, said in a statement to Nextgov/FCW .\n",
      "9. An Iranian hacker group on Sunday claimed responsibility for temporarily shuttering Truth Social, Trump’s signature social media platform. The denial of service attack occurred just after Trump announced the strikes on the nuclear targets.\n",
      "10. “Iran’s cyber strategy is likely [in] cooperation with Russia, which given current tensions, could be a real possibility. Iranian capabilities have certainly increased since the ‘Shamoon’ attacks used against oil companies back in the day,” added Harrell, referring to the 2012 virus that crippled some 30,000 computers at major energy providers.\n",
      "11. Iranian spin doctors have been found using artificial intelligence tools to spread disinformation in the U.S. and other nations. An OpenAI blog published last summer disclosed a covert campaign involving fake news websites aimed at influencing American voters, though, according to the company, the effort failed to gain significant engagement.\n",
      "12. On Friday, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a D.C.-based national security think tank, uncovered an Iranian network built to help scammers impersonate Israelis on social media and post demoralizing messages in Hebrew.\n",
      "13. “Iran has several highly-capable teams for offensive cyber operations. U.S.-based organizations should maintain vigilance and accelerate their defensive operational tempos in anticipation of retaliation,” said an industry executive with knowledge of Iranian cyber capabilities, who was granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n",
      "14. The Sunday bulletin also warned of potential physical threats inside the U.S. originating from foreign terrorist organizations or extremist groups, including calls for retaliatory violence and the targeting of people critical of Iran’s central government.\n",
      "15. “The conflict could also motivate violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators seeking to attack targets perceived to be Jewish, pro-Israel or linked to the US government or military in the homeland,” it adds.\n",
      "16. A pro-Israel hacking group said Wednesday it drained over $90 million from Iran’s largest crypto exchange, Nobitex, in the latest breach of the country’s financial networks. The group, known as Predatory Sparrow, also claimed responsibility for an earlier attack on Bank Sepah.\n",
      "17. Editor's note: This article has been updated to include mention of an Iranian-aligned hacktivist group's claim that it temporarily knocked the Truth Social platform offline.\n",

      "TITLE: OPM calls for quicker firings, more stringent performance standards\n",
      "AUTHOR: Erich Wagner\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "1. The Office of Personnel Management this week released new guidance calling on federal agencies to rate fewer employees as above average or outstanding and to discipline or fire federal workers more quickly.\n",
      "2. Much like OPM’s hiring plan , a new memo from acting OPM Director Charles Ezell to agency heads makes overtures toward the nonpartisan issue of improving performance management in government, but introduces partisan elements that could threaten the effectiveness of those reforms, experts say.\n",
      "3. “For many decades now, performance management across the federal workforce has fallen short of what the American people should expect,” Ezell wrote. “Too often, this has resulted in a lack of accountability and inflated performance ratings. Federal employee performance ratings should be normalized and reflect individual contributions to organizational results and outcomes.”\n",
      "4. To alleviate this, OPM instructed agencies to revise the annual performance plans of federal workers to better delineate between the “fully successful,” “exceeds fully successful” and “outstanding” performance ratings, as well as link an individual’s responsibilities with agency mission delivery. But language in the memo also appears to allude to agencies exploring forced distribution of ratings, which OPM has already moved to adopt for members of the Senior Executive Service , while another provision mandates that performance plans be linked specifically to “Trump administration priorities.”\n",
      "5. A former federal HR official told Government Executive that while they agreed with the need to address performance inflation, two of the primary causes of that phenomenon—low or no across-the-board federal pay raises , and the threat of reductions in force—show no sign of going away any time soon.\n",
      "6. “We already tie bonuses to your ratings, and a lot of the time that’s the only way for a supervisor to give a little bit more money to staff members that they want to recognize and try and retain,” the official said. “Until [former President] Biden came into office and issued one decent pay raise, the prior 10 years were abysmal, starting with Obama in 2013 with sequestration.”\n",
      "7. The memo also calls on agencies to make better use of firing and disciplinary authorities, as well as to shorten performance improvement plans to 30 days. But much of the reforms are rooted in improving training for supervisors and better communication between managers and frontline workers, and it remains to be seen how that would be paid for or administered, particularly after OPM shuttered the Federal Executive Institute in February.\n",
      "8. “They talk about the importance of training, which is an excellent idea, but it’s not clear where it’s going to come from or who is going to pay for it,” said Don Kettl, professor emeritus and former dean of the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. “In the case of any downsizing in government, training is always the first to go. So is there going to be investment to try to make happen what they’re proposing?”\n",
      "9. The former HR official said the plan to reduce performance improvement plans to 30 days belies the overall memo as a “red herring.”\n",
      "10. “If you can’t articulate why someone’s failing and you only give them 30 days to show that they’re no longer failing, it becomes a procedural widget to sustain a termination,” they said. “[And] the Trump administration has done such a thorough job in the last five months cutting the balls off of unions—which is a mistake, because they help provide due process—and the Merit Systems Protection Board, the [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] and [Office of Special Counsel], it’s going to be hard for current employees under these constraints to win anything.”\n",
      "11. Kettl said that the running theme of the Trump administration’s workforce policy—proposing needed reforms along with politicization efforts that undermine them—seems rooted in a fundamental mistrust of career employees.\n",
      "12. “There’s an old saying: ‘There are two ways that a civil servant can undermine a political appointee: One is to do nothing of what they say, and the other is to do everything that they say,’” he said. “The people who come in with ideas about what ought to happen and what policy ought to be always benefit from the expertise of those who have been doing it a long time, and you can see it reflected in this document. I can see what they’re trying to do, but it would benefit from the people who actually do the work giving it a once-over.”\n",

      "TITLE: Democratic leaders slam Trump effort to transfer some Education grant programs to Labor Department\n",
      "AUTHOR: Sean Michael Newhouse\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "1. Senior Democrats in a letter on Wednesday objected to Education Department plans to largely transfer responsibility over certain grant programs to the Labor Department, arguing the move represents another attempt to eliminate the agency without congressional approval.\n",
      "2. According to court documents , the departments on May 21 entered into an interagency agreement under which Labor would take over administration of career and technical education assistance grants under the 2006 Perkins Act as well as Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Title II grants for adult literacy and education programs.\n",
      "3. In their letter to Education Secretary Linda McMahon, the lawmakers wrote that the department lacks the authority to mostly hand over control over the programs, which would involve a transfer of up to $2.7 billion in fiscal 2025 alone.\n",
      "4. “Respectfully, federal agencies are not interchangeable entities that simply hand out money to states and localities,” they wrote. “Instead, each agency provides its own specific expertise in the administration of federal programs, in this case education programs.”\n",
      "5. The letter was signed by Senate Appropriations Committee vice chair Patty Murray, D-Wash., Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies ranking member Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., House Education and Workforce Committee ranking member Bobby Scott, D-Va., and House Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn.\n",
      "6. The members of Congress also expressed frustration that they were not notified about the interagency agreements and predicted that incorporating another department into the programs’ operations would lead to inefficiencies.\n",
      "7. “This likely would mean states, institutions of higher education and school districts would have to work with two federal agencies in the administration of these programs, leading to delays in agency decision-making and grant administration,” they contended.\n",
      "8. The interagency agreement is currently on hold due to an injunction that required Education to bring back its employees who were laid off under reduction-in-force procedures. Education Chief of Staff Rachel Oglesby wrote in a June 10 court filing that the injunction was preventing the agency from “pursuing operational efficiencies and cost-savings.”\n",
      "9. Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications at Education, said in a statement to Government Executive that the agreement with Labor is “one of many existing agreements ED has with other agencies to collaborate on services for the American people.” She also said that the department would respond to the Democrats’ letter.\n",
      "10. President Donald Trump in March signed an executive order that requires the drawdown of the Education Department while still preserving many of its programs. Court documents also show that Education, prior to the injunction, was negotiating a memorandum of understanding through which employees would be detailed to the Treasury Department to work on student loan management.\n",

      "TITLE: DOGE holds meetings with White House, new postal leadership and Treasury to discuss reforming USPS\n",
      "AUTHOR: Eric Katz\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "1. The White House and its Department of Government Efficiency are spearheading efforts to shake up the Postal Service, according to details of the meetings obtained by Government Executive , with topics including pricing for mail and general reform proposals.\n",
      "2. The meetings were not clearly within the scope of a memorandum of understanding former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy signed with DOGE, which focused on specific cost-cutting measures and real estate planning. Some of the meetings also involved top officials from the Treasury Department, White House attorneys and policy advisors and additional USPS executives. A source familiar with the meetings confirmed DOGE has been active at the Postal Service’s Washington headquarters in recent months.\n",
      "3. The meetings began in late March, just days after DeJoy resigned amid pressure from the Trump administration. Acting Postmaster General Doug Tulino met with DOGE the day he was sworn into his new role to discuss ethics, according to details from the meeting. Two DOGE team members—Alex Simonpour and Ethan Shaotran, both of whom have MOUs of their own with USPS—were present, along with other postal executives.\n",
      "4. In April, Simonpour and Shaotran met again with Tulino and postal leaders, including Fiona Machado, USPS' director for pricing and costing strategy support. That was followed by another meeting with postal officials, including the new USPS Chief Financial Officer Luke Grossman, to discuss an exigent price increase. The Postal Service can request authority to implement rate hikes outside its normal price caps in emergency situations, which it has not done since 2013. USPS is set to raise the price of a stamp to 78 cents in July, which would mark a 42% increase over the last five years since DeJoy took office.\n",
      "5. In May, Clark Milner, a White House senior advisor for policy, organized a meeting with the DOGE, including James Burnham, its chief attorney, and members of the Domestic Policy Council. Among those in the policy team was James Sherk, an architect of the Trump administration’s initiatives to cut federal rolls and weaken protections afforded by civil service laws.\n",
      "6. Earlier this month, Sherk spearheaded a meeting with officials throughout the administration to discuss postal reform. Among the invitees were the chief of staff, the deputy assistant secretary and the assistant secretary for management at Treasury. Several White House attorneys, policy advisors and a representative from Vice President J.D. Vance’s office were also invited.\n",
      "7. In March, DeJoy sent a letter to lawmakers explaining that DOGE would only be authorized to work with his agency on matters related to USPS retirement plans, workers compensation costs, congressional liaisoning regarding costs incurred by legislative mandates, reforms to its regulatory requirements, retail lease renewals, business opportunities with other federal agencies and counterfeit postage.\n",
      "8. “These are the only initiatives that I have requested and authorized the DOGE team to assist on thus far, and only the data and information required to pursue these initiatives will be provided to the DOGE team members,” DeJoy said.\n",
      "9. While pricing matters and general reform were not included in that list, DeJoy mentioned the Postal Service’s regulator has stood in the way of “timely and necessary changes required to succeed as a self-funded enterprise.” All price hikes, including exigent increases, must receive approval from the Postal Regulatory Commission.\n",
      "10. The Postal Service declined to comment for this story. The White House and Treasury Department did not respond to multiple inquiries.\n",
      "11. David Steiner, a long-time CEO of Waste Management and FedEx board member, will take over as postmaster general in July. Mike Plunkett, long-time postal executive turned president of the Association for Postal Commerce, said it was surprising the current leadership team would be discussing such significant shakeups just two weeks before the organization swears in a new CEO. He added it would be difficult to justify an exigent price hike when the agnecy is already implementing a rate hike next month.\n",
      "12. Prior to taking office this year, Trump suggested he might seek to privatize USPS entirely —resurrecting a proposal from his first term . Trump said in February, however, that the Postal Service would continue to exist as a public entity even if it was no longer a standalone agency. Elon Musk, who until recently led DOGE’s efforts, subsequently said USPS should be privatized.\n",
      "13. Trump was considering signing an executive order to fold USPS into the Commerce Department, The Washington Post reported earlier this year, though that plan never came to fruition. Pierre Gentin, a senior advisor to Commerce Department Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trump's nominee to serve as the agency's general counsel, was invited to the June postal reform meeting.\n",

      "TITLE: Trump’s pick to lead Customs and Border Protection confirmed by Senate\n",
      "AUTHOR: Ariana Figueroa\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "1. The Senate on Wednesday confirmed President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead Customs and Border Protection, a major role for carrying out the president’s border enforcement agenda and the handling of unauthorized migration.\n",
      "2. In a 51-46 party-line vote, the Senate confirmed Rodney Scott of Oklahoma.\n",
      "3. Scott previously served as the chief of the Border Patrol, an agency within CBP, during the first Trump administration and under former President Joe Biden.\n",
      "4. During the first Trump administration, Scott implemented a policy that required asylum-seekers to remain in Mexico while their cases were pending in immigration court.\n",
      "5. As the new head of CBP, Scott will oversee more than 60,000 employees. The agency also manages more than 300 ports of entry at borders, airports and seaports.\n",
      "6. During his Senate confirmation hearing in April, the Senate Finance Committee’s top Democrat, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, raised concerns about the 2010 death of an immigrant at a CBP station in San Diego that Scott ran.\n",
      "7. Anastasio Hernández Rojas was detained by CBP officers and was beaten, later dying from his injuries, Wyden said.\n",
      "8. “Rather than following the agency’s own policy and immediately referring the incident to outside investigators, the San Diego CBP office began its own investigation,” Wyden said. “In the course of that investigation, the CBP officers taped over the only video copy of Hernández Rojas’s death and tampered with physical evidence, according to court documents.”\n",
      "9. The United States paid $1 million to settle a lawsuit brought by Hernández Rojas’s widow, and in 2015 the Justice Department declined to pursue federal charges against any of the officers or leaders involved in the case.\n",
      "10. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sent a letter to the committee before Scott’s confirmation hearing and informed senators that the agency reviewed the 2010 incident and that Scott’s work “was in accordance with his duties, the law and professional standards.”\n",

      "1. In 1895, science fiction writer H.G. Wells introduced the world to the concept of time travel. Pick a time, he told his dinner guests in The Time Machine, and manipulate a lever in his machine: “this lever, being pressed over, sends the machine gliding into the future, and this other reverses the motion.”\n",
      "2. That’s the stage we’ve set with the current debate on the merit system. The real debate between the Trump administration reformers and others in the battle is where they want to set the lever for merit system principles. If truth be told, no one—right, left, center—likes the current merit system.\n",
      "3. So, if we know what we don’t like, where should we set our time machine setting? Here are some settings.\n",
      "4. And, to help you set your time machine lever, here’s a chart of how the percentage of federal employees covered by the federal civil service has changed over time.\n",
      "5. Some friends of mine have said they would set it at 1911, just before the passage of the Lloyd-LaFollette Act, at a time when merit determined the hiring of federal employees but when presidents had much more power to dismiss employees. Others have said 1945, before the GS classification system emerged. One experienced expert told me it would be 1977, before the 1978 reforms that, in the expert’s opinion, introduced the pathologies that make human resources managers so unhappy today. And, of course, some of my conservative friends would choose the current Trump action.\n",

      "TITLE: Trump watchdog nominees draw congressional scrutiny for political histories\n",
      "AUTHOR: Sean Michael Newhouse\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "1. A pair of President Donald Trump’s picks for agency inspectors general — Anthony D’Esposito for Labor and Cheryl Mason at the Veterans Affairs Department — have faced inquiries during their confirmation hearings in recent weeks from senators concerned about their ability to act independently from the administration.\n",
      "2. The pair are vying to replace former Labor and VA IGs, who, along with more than a dozen other agency watchdogs who investigate waste, fraud and abuse, were fired by Trump the first week of his second term. At the time, the president said: “I don’t know [the IGs]…but some people thought that some were unfair, some were not doing their job.”\n",
      "3. Both D’Esposito and Mason, testifying weeks apart, faced scrutiny due to their political support for the president and past roles working under Trump-appointed department secretaries.\n",
      "4. D’Esposito, a former New York Republican congressman, touted his law enforcement experience Wednesday during a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing and swore to visit every IG regional office.\n",
      "5. “I will travel to each of the regional offices and hear from the men and women on the ground to find out what is actually happening [and] what we can do better,” he said. “Quite frankly, I think they need to feel that they're heard and that they're believed in, and that would make it a more efficient and more productive inspector general's office.”\n",
      "6. D’Esposito also said that he would prioritize working with local police to combat child labor law violations, particularly as they relate to illegal immigration.\n",
      "7. Committee Chair Bill Cassidy, R-La., told D’Esposito that he had a “great background” for the role, but Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., said it was “concerning” that he wouldn’t commit to continuing open investigations that were initiated by the previous Labor IG without seeing them first.\n",
      "8. If confirmed, D’Esposito said he would lead the Labor IG office “without fear or favor.” Throughout the hearing, he said that this is a “golden age of the American worker,” which is a Trump slogan — although he argued that it is nonpartisan.\n",
      "9. Senators did not ask D'Esposito about past controversies, including a 2024 report from The New York Times that he may have violated House ethics rules by allegedly hiring his fiancee’s daughter as well as a woman with whom he was alleged to have had an affair.\n",
      "10. Democrats on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee criticized Mason during her June 4 hearing for her previous role as a senior advisor to VA Secretary Doug Collins, with ranking member Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., asserting the position made Mason unsuitable for a role providing oversight of the department.\n",
      "11. “You have been earning your pay as a loyal advisor, a member of the Collins team, an employee at his behest, a political appointee, not as a career civil servant,” Blumenthal said. “You are a political appointee as inspector general and that is why I will object to your nomination.”\n",
      "12. Mason cited her 28 years of experience at the VA, including as chair of the Board of Veterans Appeals during Trump’s first term, and said her work as a senior advisor to Collins would align with her work as an IG.\n",
      "13. “The senior advisor role was to convey, gather information much like a fact finder does and convey that information to the secretary and to other senior leaders,” she said. “So it's very — it correlates well to the inspector general. The difference is the inspector general has teeth and that is very much what is needed in the department.”\n",
      "14. Mason also flummoxed Blumenthal when she said that she wasn’t involved in any decisions or actions at the VA since Trump’s inauguration.\n",
      "15. “As a senior advisor, I’m not involved in any decisions,” she said, later adding “My role was to gather information and convey that information back.”\n",
      "16. “I can't believe that you are telling us that you haven't been involved in a single action or decision as an advisor,” Blumenthal replied.\n",
      "17. Democrats also questioned Mason’s assertion that she does not have a “close” relationship with Collins.\n",
      "18. Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, who caucuses with the Democrats, recalled that Mason, while visiting his office, remarked after seeing a Coke machine that “the secretary is a Coke guy.” Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who previously served as an assistant secretary in the VA, seized on the fact that Mason’s office was in the secretary’s suite.\n",
      "19. “I know exactly what the inner sanctum of the secretary's office looks like and if you're behind those doors, you're in the inner sanctum, you're not just floating out there,” Duckworth said. “So you probably saw him a lot more than you are trying to lead us to believe.”\n",
      "20. Mason said that she would prioritize implementing more than 500 open recommendations from the VA IG. She denied being involved in the mass firings of VA employees , plans to downsize the department workforce by around 80,000 employees or requiring workers to sign non-disclosure agreements .\n",
      "21. She was, however, behind a policy that prohibited Veterans Benefits Administration employees from contacting the VA Office of General Counsel without her approval.\n",

      "TITLE: Judge grills DOJ official on order tying transportation funding to immigration enforcement\n",
      "AUTHOR: Ariana Figueroa\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "1. A Rhode Island federal judge seemed likely Wednesday to block the Transportation Department’s move to yank billions in congressional funding for bridges, roads and airport projects if Democrat-led states do not partake in federal immigration enforcement.\n",
      "2. U.S. District Judge John James McConnell Jr. during a hearing pressed acting U.S. Attorney Sara Miron Bloom on how the Transportation Department could have power over funding that was approved by Congress, saying federal agencies “only have appropriations power given by Congress.”\n",
      "3. “That's how the Constitution works,” he said. “Where does the secretary get the power and authority to impose immigration conditions on transportation funding?”\n",
      "4. The suit brought by 20 Democratic state attorneys general challenges an April directive from Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, a former House member from Wisconsin, that requires states to cooperate in federal immigration enforcement in order to receive federal grants already approved by Congress.\n",
      "5. “Defendents seek to hold hostage tens of billions of dollars of critical transportation funding in order to force the plaintiff states to become mere arms of the federal government's immigration enforcement policies,” Delbert Tran of the California Department of Justice, who argued on behalf of the states, said.\n",
      "6. Arguing on behalf of the Trump administration, Bloom said that Duffy’s letter simply directs the states to follow federal immigration law.\n",
      "7. McConnell, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2011, said that while the states could interpret it that way, the Trump administration has gone after so-called sanctuary cities and targeted them for not taking the same aggressive immigration enforcement as the administration.\n",
      "8. The judge said Bloom’s argument expressed a “very different” interpretation of the directive than how the administration has described it publicly. He also noted President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have “railed on … the issues that arise from sanctuary cities.”\n",
      "9. Trump this week directed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to target Chicago, Los Angeles and New York — three major Democrat-led cities that have policies to not aid in immigration enforcement.\n",
      "10. McConnell said he would make a decision whether to issue a preliminary injunction before Friday. The preliminary injunction would be tailored to the states that brought the suit and would not have a nationwide effect.\n",
      "11. The states that brought the suit are California, Illinois, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Maryland, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.\n",
      "12. Tran said the Department of Transportation’s directive is not only arbitrary and capricious, but undermines congressional authority because Congress appropriated more than $100 billion for transportation projects to the states.\n",
      "13. Cutting off funding would have disastrous consequences, the states have argued.\n",
      "14. “More cars, planes, and trains will crash, and more people will die as a result, if Defendants cut off federal funding to Plaintiff States,” according to the brief from the states.\n",
      "15. Bloom defended Duffy’s letter, saying it listed actions that would impede federal law enforcement and justified withholding of funds because “such actions compromise the safety and security of the transportation systems supported by DOT financial assistance.”\n",
      "16. McConnell said that didn’t answer his question about the secretary’s authority to withhold congressionally appropriated funding.\n",
      "17. “It seems to me that the secretary is saying that a failure to comply with immigration conditions is relevant to the safety and security of the transportation system,” Bloom said.\n",
      "18. McConnell seemed skeptical of that argument.\n",
      "19. “Under that rationale, does the secretary of the Department of Transportation have the authority to impose a condition on federal highway funds that prohibit a state that has legalized abortion from seeking a federal grant?” he asked.\n",

      "TITLE: ‘Censorship:’ See the National Park visitor responses after Trump requested help deleting ‘negative’ signage\n",
      "AUTHOR: Eric Katz\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "1. The Trump administration recently began posting signs on federal parks and historic sites asking for help from visitors in identifying language that negatively discussed America’s past or present and launched a process for federal agencies to remove, cover or replace flagged materials.\n",
      "2. In the responses submitted by visitors to National Park Service sites, however, which were obtained by Government Executive , no single submission pointed to any such examples. Instead, in the nearly 200 submissions NPS received in the first days since the solicitations were posted, visitors implored the administration not to erase U.S. history and praised agency staff for improving their experiences.\n",
      "3. The new request at NPS and other Interior Department sites followed an executive order from President Trump dubbed “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History” that called for federal lands to remove information that could “improperly minimize or disparage certain historical figures or events.” That in turn led to an order from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum that department staff solicit public feedback to flag “any signs or other information that are negative about either past or living Americans or that fail to emphasize the beauty, grandeur, and abundance of landscapes and other natural features.” The reviews should include exhibits, brochures, films, waysides and signs, the secretary said.\n",
      "4. In instructions to staff also obtained by Government Executive , NPS employees were told to review feedback from visitors weekly but not yet remove any materials. For each comment, staff can either mark it as received but not requiring action, requiring action but not related to the signage issue or flagged for review by NPS leadership in Washington. Parks will receive follow up information in August.\n",
      "5. In the meantime, NPS said, the agency’s Harpers Ferry Center is currently “developing standard protocols and templates to assist with expedited removal, covering, or temporary replacement of any media that does not comply with” Burgum's order. It added a “long-term plan for permanent replacement is also under development for affected media.”\n",
      "6. So far, NPS is not getting the help it was hoping for from those scanning the QR codes now posted around park sites soliciting assistance in identifying language in violation of Trump and Burgum’s orders. Instead, visitors accused the Trump administration of seeking to erase the nation’s history.\n",
      "7. “There shouldn't be signs about history that whitewash and erase the centuries of discrimination against the people who have cared for this land for generations,” a visitor to Indian Dunes National Park said.\n",
      "8. A visitor to Independence Hall in Philadelphia called the new signs “censorship dressed up as customer service.”\n",
      "9. “What upset me the most about the museum—more than anything in the actual exhibits—were the signs telling people to report anything they thought was negative about Americans,” the visitor said. “That isn't just frustrating, it's outrageous. It felt like an open invitation to police and attack historians for simply doing their jobs: telling the truth.”\n",
      "10. Several visitors to the Stonewall National Monument in New York lamented changes there the park’s website that removed mention of transgender individuals in the Stonewall Uprising.\n",
      "11. “Put them back,” the visitor said. “Honor them. There would be no Stonewall without trans people.”\n",
      "12. A visitor at Yellowstone National Park said the information presented there should challenge people.\n",
      "13. “The executive order to asking for feedback is ****,” the message read. “Parks already do an amazing job telling stories that contain hard truths and everyone is entitled to the truth to make better decisions in our lives. So what if people feel bad?”\n",
      "14. Without factual information, the person added, “everything is just a pretty facade with no real substance.”\n",
      "15. At Manzanar National Historical Site, one of the internment camps that held Japanese immigrants and Japanese-Americans during World War II, a visitor said the site existed to present information about the costly errors in U.S. history.\n",
      "16. “The entire purpose of parks like this one is to learn from the mistakes of the past so we can avoid repeating them,” the visitor said. “Please do not water down the reality of the experience for future visitors.”\n",
      "17. A visitor at the Natchez National Historical Park had a similar takeaway.\n",
      "18. “Slavery was a dark time in our history and we need to come to terms with that,” the individual said, “not gloss it over and romanticize the Antebellum South.”\n",
      "19. Only one visitor—at Petersburg National Battlefield, a Civil War site—noted they read signs that “didn’t sit right,” though the individual did not specify any materials that needed changing. Instead, the person requested a “second look” to potentially identify “more balance.” A Grand Canyon National Park visitor said the site should change its signs, but added “signed, Elon,” suggesting the comment was left in jest.\n",
      "20. Many of the comments asked NPS to include more information that highlighted the U.S. government’s discriminatory practices toward Native Americans. A bevy of visitors also asked for increased staffing and complimented the steps existing employees took to improve their experiences.\n",
      "21. Theresa Pierno, president of the National Parks Conservation Association, called the directive requiring park staff to post the new signs with accompanying QR codes “an outrage” that shows the “deep contempt for their work to preserve and tell American stories.”\n",
      "22. “If our country erases the darker chapters of our history, we will never learn from our mistakes,” Pierno said. “These signs must come down immediately.”\n",
      "23. An Interior Department spokesperson said in response to a request for comment that leaks “will not be tolerated.”\n",
      "24. “It is a true shame that employees are spending their time leaking to the media instead of doing work for the American people, the spokesperson said. “The same American people who fund their paychecks.”\n",
      "25. Trump, in his executive order, said federal lands should display materials that amplify American greatness.\n",
      "26. Park materials should “focus on the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people or, with respect to natural features, the beauty, abundance, and grandeur of the American landscape,” Trump said.\n",
      "27. The Independence Hall visitor suggested that line of thinking would not effect the desired result.\n",
      "28. “Putting up signs like that doesn't protect anyone, [it] just tells visitors that the truth is a problem,” the visitor said. “And I can't think of anything more offensive than that.”\n",
      "29. This story has been updated with comment from Interior.\n",

      "TITLE: EEOC nominee would likely lead ‘real retreat’ from agency’s civil rights mission\n",
      "AUTHOR: Amanda Becker\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "1. When a U.S. Senate panel holds a confirmation hearing on Wednesday for Andrea Lucas to lead the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the agency’s former leaders say they will be paying close attention to what she says about EEOC guidance related to pregnancy discrimination and gender identity harassment.\n",
      "2. Lucas has served on the commission since 2020, when President Donald Trump nominated her during his first term. In January, he named her acting chair after firing two of three Democrats serving on the five-member commission before their terms ended — a first by a president in the agency’s 60-year history .\n",
      "3. With only two of five commissioners remaining, the EEOC has not had the necessary quorum to implement meaningful policy directives during Lucas’ interim tenure. Even still, agency observers said, Lucas, who is expected to be confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate, has repeatedly indicated that she plans to make it more difficult for pregnant and gender-diverse people to bring civil rights claims related to their employment.\n",
      "4. EEOC cases involving trans plaintiffs are already at a standstill, whether their harassment claims are related to their gender identities or not, those familiar with the agency’s caseload told The 19th. Lucas wants to revisit regulations related to enforcement of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act that were finalized one year ago today . She has also played a prominent role in the president’s efforts to quash diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, or DEI, in workplaces, sending an unprecedented letter to law firms that countered agency procedure. In a public statement released in late May, Lucas said part of the EEOC’s commitment to enforcing Trump’s DEI orders means backing away from cases related to “neutral employment policy or practice” that has “an unequal outcome on employees of a particular race of sex.”\n",
      "5. Maya Raghu, a senior adviser to a Democratic EEOC commissioner during the Biden administration, called these cases, known as disparate impact-claims, a “powerful tool that helps uncover and remedy discrimination that isn't explicit and ensures that everyone has a fair chance to succeed.”\n",
      "6. Disparate impact cases are often associated with remedying structural racial discrimination but can also be related to sex, gender and disability. The EEOC only had one open disparate impact case, brought in 2024 , challenging hiring policies at Sheetz. The gas station chain screened applicants for criminal convictions, and the agency brought a case due to the disparate impact it had on Black and Indigenous applicants. The EEOC earlier this month moved to dismiss the case , citing Trump’s DEI orders. A worker plaintiff has sought private legal counsel to continue the case.\n",
      "7. “Eliminating disparate impact cases, or de-prioritizing them, as this administration is saying, would really take us back to a time when employers could impose policies that unfairly deny opportunities to people of color, women, older Americans and other historically excluded groups without really having to provide a business necessity for the policies,” said Raghu, who is now at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law directing a project on advancing diversity, equity and inclusion.\n",
      "8. Lucas has also signaled her disapproval of long awaited anti-harassment guidance that the EEOC approved in April 2024 , following the Supreme Court’s 2020 decision in Bostock v. Clayton County. It clarified how the agency would enforce workplace harassment related to “race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetic information.” Lucas voted against it and issued a dissent focused on gender identity, writing that “women’s sex-based rights in the workplace are under attack — and from the EEOC, the very federal agency charged with protecting women from sexual harassment and sex-based discrimination at work.”\n",
      "9. Lucas argued that the position taken by the EEOC in the guidance that denying workers access to bathrooms that matched their gender identities or the intentional use of the wrong pronouns could constitute harassment “impinges on women’s (and indeed, all employees’) rights to freedom of speech and belief.” “Biological sex is real, and it matters. Sex is binary (male and female) and is immutable,” she wrote in the dissent.\n",
      "10. If Lucas is confirmed, and once a quorum is established, the agency is expected to revisit the harassment guidance. She has already drafted and released changes she would like to see, removing mentions of gender identity. Further, the agency went through its open cases and paused many brought by trans plaintiffs, even when their claims involved harassment unrelated to their gender identity, like disability or race, according to multiple people familiar with the agency’s work.\n",
      "11. A federal judge in Texas last month vacated sections of the harassment guidance related to gender identity but the Supreme Court’s 2020 decision in Bostock remains law and the decision is limited in its application.\n",
      "12. Former EEOC Commissioner Chai Feldblum, who served from 2010 to 2019, said there are “two problems going on at the EEOC right now” related to gender identity.\n",
      "13. “One is if you have a gender-identity claim, our understanding is that they're not necessarily immediately dismissing those — although I'm sure they're doing that with a number of them — but they're just putting it in black holes and not doing anything,” Feldblum explained. “But it’s also being over applied in offices around the country so that even if a transgender person comes in with a disability claim, or they come in with a sexual harassment charge not related to their gender identity, their charge is not being done.”\n",
      "14. “Transgender people are being adversely affected, both with regard to gender identity claims and with regard to unrelated claims,” said Feldblum, who earlier this year co-founded the EEO Leadership Group . Feldblum said she initially got the group of former EEOC leaders together to see if they could help represent transgender plaintiffs whose cases were languishing. Ahead of Lucas’ hearing this week, they released a letter responding to her revised harassment guidance.\n",
      "15. EEO Leadership Group members said another aspect of the agency’s work that they expect to come up during Lucas’ hearing that would disproportionately affect women is her desire to revisit the guidance related to pregnant workers issued last year.\n",
      "16. Lucas also voted against that final rule and released a 16-page dissent . She wrote that while she supported “elements,” she believed the rule established “new accommodation requirements to reach virtually every condition, circumstance, or procedure that relates to any aspect of the female reproductive system.”\n",
      "17. While Lucas’ desire to revisit the pregnancy guidance is rooted in her opposition to abortion and related workforce accommodations, “once they reopen it, they can make any changes that a majority agrees on,” noted Karla Gilbride, who was general counsel at the EEOC until February, when she joined the public interest law firm Public Citizen. Gilbride is also a member of the EEO Leadership Group.\n",
      "18. Jenny Yang, another former EEOC commissioner and member of the leadership group who now is a partner at the law from Outten & Golden, said that Lucas’ public positions, when combined with her focus on Trump’s DEI efforts and her letter to law firms, indicate that under her leadership, the EEOC would operate very differently than it has in the past.\n",
      "19. “Unfortunately, it does appear that Lucas’ priorities are a real retreat from the historic mission of the agency,” Yang said. “I think that she is demonstrating that she's a full participant in this administration's effort to intimidate employers from engaging in fully lawful efforts to prevent discrimination.”\n",

      "TITLE: New pay claims for active-duty federal employees possible after Supreme Court decision\n",
      "AUTHOR: Carten Cordell\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "1. A recent ruling by the Supreme Court could mean a new rash of pay claims for federal employees who may also serve as military reservists.\n",
      "2. The court ruled on April 30 in its Feliciano v. Department of Transportation decision that military reservists called up to active duty during a national emergency are entitled to the difference between their military and civilian salaries regardless of whether that service was substantially connected to the emergency in question.\n",
      "3. That means federal employees that also serve as military reservists may have new claims on differential pay based on their past active duty service, and the Merit Systems Protection Board, which handles the claims, may soon have more work.\n",
      "4. “Differential pay is codified and provided for for federal employees that are impacted and called to active duty,” said Michael Macomber, partner and CEO at Tully Rinckey PLLC, a national law firm with an extensive government services practice. “What ultimately the Supreme Court found here, it is making it easier for reservists who are impacted who want to file claims to prove that they were, in fact, impacted.”\n",
      "5. The decision stems from a lawsuit filed by Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controller Nick Feliciano, who also served as a Coast Guard reserve petty officer. Feliciano was called up in July 2012 and remained on active duty until February 2017, “serving aboard a Coast Guard ship escorting vessels to and from harbor” that had supported Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, noting that his orders in support of several contingency operations.\n",
      "6. The MSPB rejected Feliciano’s claims for differential pay during his service and he appealed to the Federal Circuit, which also ruled against him, citing “he must show not only that he served while a national emergency was ongoing, but also that a substantive connection linked his service to a particular national emergency.”\n",
      "7. But the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that Feliciano did not need to establish that his service was substantially connected to a national emergency because it was supporting contingency operations.\n",
      "8. Macomber said since the decision, Tully Rinckey has received “dozens if not hundreds of inquiries from federal employees about their eligibility for such claims, given that the law firm has worked with feds in the past to obtain the documentation needed to assert such claims.\n",
      "9. Those claims will be first filed with the MSPB, which is currently without a quorum after President Trump fired board member Cathy Harris i n February , the Supreme Court temporarily upheld the firing in May, pending a full ruling the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\n",
      "10. A spokesperson for the MSPB said corrective action on differential pay claims would only be delayed “if the initial decision is appealed by either party” and that regional and field offices remain fully functional to handle such claims. The spokesperson added that MSPB has not yet seen a noticeable uptick in the claims following the Feliciano decision.\n",
      "11. Macomber said that the decision highlights new resources that federal employees may not even be aware that they have access to.\n",
      "12. “I think the real benefit at this point in time is making sure that employees are aware of these benefits and that they should be applying for these benefits,” he said. “What I see is a lot of people not applying for them and not taking advantage benefits available to them.”\n",

      "TITLE: With DeJoy out, postal stakeholders push for pause in criticized Delivering for America overhaul plan\n",
      "AUTHOR: Sean Michael Newhouse\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "1. As a new leader takes the helm of the U.S. Postal Service, a House panel on Tuesday debated the future of the independent entity. While no member of Congress or expert witness offered a new comprehensive vision, there was near universal consensus on pausing and even reversing the recent reforms of former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy.\n",
      "2. DeJoy’s 10-year plan to promote the financial sustainability of USPS, dubbed Delivering for America, started in 2021 and aimed at slowing some delivery but generate savings . Specifically, it required mail to sit overnight at post offices instead of being collected each evening to be transported to a processing center and sought to consolidate processing plants into 60 regional distribution centers.\n",
      "3. Additionally, stamp prices have increased six times since the start of DeJoy’s tenure and that amount is set to rise again in July to 78 cents. These overhauls, however, did not generate revenue. USPS lost $9.5 billion in fiscal 2024 and experienced a net loss of $3.3 billion for the most recent quarter.\n",
      "4. “Under the Delivering for America plan, our members have suffered unprecedented rate increases and service degradation as the postal service records staggering losses and squanders mailer-funded capital on excess package and processing capacity,” said Mike Plunkett, the CEO and president of the Association for Postal Commerce, which represents businesses that use the mail. “If the incoming PMG is to have any chance at success, the postal service must immediately pause implementation of Delivering for America.”\n",
      "5. Specifically, Plunkett called for a moratorium on rate increases, a pause in spending on building new facilities and halting any product changes while new leadership assesses what reforms to keep, modify or unwind.\n",
      "6. Likewise, Jim Cochrane, the CEO of the Package Shippers Association, a trade organization, testified that USPS needs a “new vision” to improve its finances.\n",
      "7. “The Delivering for America plan has created a widespread degradation of package delivery service performance,” he said. “The changes, unfortunately, disproportionately affect rural communities and those in remote areas of the country.”\n",
      "8. Cochrane touted public-private partnerships, particularly for the “middle mile” when mail is transported between processing facilities.\n",
      "9. Criticizing Delivering for America has been a bipartisan trend and that continued Tuesday.\n",
      "10. Paul Steidler of the Lexington Institute and Thomas Schatz of Citizens Against Government Waste, both of which are conservative think tanks, argued for a pause in the overhaul plan. And the top Democrat on the Government Operations Subcommittee alluded to it in his opening remarks.\n",
      "11. “A lot of people have been asking me ‘Why are we paying more money for the same service?’” said ranking member Kweisi Mfume, D-Md. “And some cynically say ‘Why are we paying more money for an even worse service?’”\n",
      "12. The bipartisan USPS board of governors selected David Steiner, a longtime CEO of Waste Management and FedEx board member, to be the next postmaster general. DeJoy in March was pressured to resign due to conflicts with the Department of Government Efficiency, according to The Washington Post .\n",
      "13. The postal board has been generally supportive of Delivering for America, contending that it is necessary to modernize USPS.\n",
      "14. President Donald Trump, who reportedly backed Steiner , has mused about privatizing USPS or folding it under the Commerce Department.\n",

      "TITLE: How shrinking the EPA could make wildfire smoke even more dangerous\n",
      "AUTHOR: Grist\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "1. For weeks, smoke from Canadian wildfires has poured down into the United States, drifting clear across the Atlantic into Europe . Pulmonologist Vivek Balasubramaniam, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, noticed more people calling in with asthma symptoms and asking for advice when smoke doused the region in early June.\n",
      "2. “Walking outside those days, I mean, you could see the brown-orange discoloration to the air,” he said. “When you’re breathing in, you kind of feel like the air is a little heavier, a little harder to do things.”\n",
      "3. Monitoring air quality is key to forecasting and assessing wildfire smoke. Right now, that’s a coordinated effort between federal, state, tribal, and local entities. Federally approved and privately operated monitors feed data into tools like the Environmental Protection Agency’s AirNow tool, and help forecast air quality and issue public health guidance. But air quality scientists worry that EPA budget and job cuts will make it difficult to get air quality information to people, endangering public health. And when it comes to longer-term research, some experts say community monitors won’t fill in the gap.\n",
      "4. The Trump administration announced plans last month to reorganize the agency and cut staff back to levels last seen in the Reagan era, which could mean the elimination of thousands of jobs. The EPA’s proposed budget for 2026 would halve its funding , from $9.14 billion to $4.16 billion.\n",
      "5. “This is really disappointing,” said Christi Chester-Schroeder, lead air quality scientist at IQAir, a free platform. “And honestly, it is sort of antithetical, in the sense that the healthcare costs associated with breathing poor quality error are really significant globally.”\n",
      "6. Along with proposed cuts to grants for state and local air quality management and pollution control, the EPA is planning to restructure how it regulates air quality, dismantl ing two offices charged with regulating air and climate pollution and running such programs: the Office of Atmospheric Protection and the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards.\n",
      "7. The EPA plans to create two new offices to clear a backlog of state plans to meet national air quality standards. A spokesperson said in an email that the new Office of State Air Partnerships would “improve coordination with state, local, and tribal air permitting agencies” to “resolve permitting concerns more efficiently and ensure EPA is working with states, not against them, to advance our shared mission.” The Office of Clean Air Programs would “align statutory obligations and essential functions with centers of expertise to create greater transparency in our regulatory work.”\n",
      "8. Pushback on staffing and funding cuts has been constant. A U.S. District Court judge in Maryland ruled last week that the agency’s termination of $600 million in grants to help communities address pollution was unlawful. And the largest federal workers union was part of a coalition that sued this spring to halt cuts. A federal judge ruled in their favor in May, blocking new layoff and reorganization notices.\n",
      "9. “EPA is complying with the court’s preliminary injunction,” said an EPA spokesperson of the lawsuit in an email. “In line with the court’s order and guidance received by the Department of Justice, EPA is moving forward with only reorganization planning activities.”\n",
      "10. But the agency has already been hamstrung, according to Cathleen Kelly, a senior fellow at the left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress, who said that eliminating the current air monitoring offices would harm research and public health — even if some of their components are preserved elsewhere.\n",
      "11. “It will leave communities more vulnerable when wildfire smoke makes the air unhealthy to breathe, for example, or when corporate polluters release unlawful amounts of pollution and on bad air quality days that increase asthma attacks and land kids and adults that are struggling to breathe in the hospital,” she said.\n",
      "12. Overall, air quality in the U.S. has improved in the decades since the Clean Air Act was enacted in 1970 and began more strictly regulating industrial pollution. The EPA’s own sophisticated monitors have been able to track changes over time, confirming how effective air quality regulations are.\n",
      "13. That progress has been curtailed as wildfire smoke has become more prevalent , and even one bad wildfire season can put the health of communities at risk, with Indigenous nations, low-income communities, and communities of color disproportionately affected. The American Lung Association says nearly half of Americans live with unhealthy levels of air pollution, and that wildfire smoke is a major factor. It can spread far from its source, affecting urban areas that are already dealing with pollution from industry and transportation as well as rural communities with less monitoring because they have fewer people.\n",
      "14. As the EPA seeks to cut jobs, some experts worry there won’t be the staff — or the institutional expertise — to process and distribute that data even if air quality monitors continue to collect readings. And as the EPA guts environmental regulations, like rolling back clean air rules for power plants , it may be harder for scientists to properly assess impacts to public health.\n",
      "15. “That’s, to me, the most concerning consequence,” said Tarik Benmarhnia, a professor of environmental epidemiology at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography who studies wildfire smoke.\n",
      "16. The main hazard in wildfire smoke is PM 2.5, or particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns (a millionth of a meter). This is bad for anyone to breathe, but especially hazardous for those with asthma or heart conditions. As wildfire smoke travels through the atmosphere, it also changes chemically to produce the toxic gas ozone, making breathing the stuff even more hazardous.\n",
      "17. Canadian scientists are also worried that the fires are burning across soils heavily polluted by mining operations , so the smoke could be laced with toxicants like arsenic and lead.\n",
      "18. As climate change exacerbates droughts and raises temperatures — which sucks up the moisture in vegetation — more landscapes are burning and loading the atmosphere with smoke. Recent research has shown that the human health impact of PM 2.5 from wildfire smoke can be up to 10 times higher than other sources of particulate matter, said Benmarhnia. A study published last month in the journal Communications Earth and Environment found that between 2006 and 2020, climate change contributed to 15,000 deaths due to particulate matter from wildfire smoke.\n",
      "19. To understand how wildfire smoke is affecting people’s health and warn them of its dangers, it needs to be measured. Places like the Great Lakes that aren’t used to dealing with wildfires and their fallout are just now solidifying public health awareness campaigns.\n",
      "20. “The first statewide air quality alert for fine particulate matter from wildfire smoke was in 2023,” said Aaron Ferguson, who manages the Climate and Tracking Unit at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. “That’s really when we first started developing a lot of our public health guidance and response strategies.”\n",
      "21. That work relies in part on more than 40 air quality stations run by the state through EPA grants that are still in place for now.\n",
      "22. Increasingly, federal air quality monitors have been supplemented by private companies and community monitoring efforts, including among tribal nations, rural areas and places federal and state governments have neglected. Free services like PurpleAir and IQAir provide hyper-local air quality readings for people to determine if they need to shelter from wildfire smoke.\n",
      "23. “What people are using this for is to decide when to let the kids out with asthma, or when to go cycling if they’re an athlete,” said Adrian Dybwad, CEO and founder of PurpleAir.\n",
      "24. Pierce Mayville, the air quality scientist for the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, said those monitors are “huge” when it comes to getting people usable, practical information, providing near-real-time information about air quality. They have one and are setting up another.\n",
      "25. “If we see the level really high in the purple, then we let people know,” Mayville said. “People can look at the map and see a live-time view of what’s going on so they can keep track of the air quality in their area.”\n",
      "26. What Benmarhnia and other scientists need is a steady stream of reliable data, especially from advanced sensors that determine the composition of wildfire smoke, like if it contains heavy metals. Cheaper instruments just measure the amount of PM 2.5 in the air, not what it’s made of. They can then correlate that data with hospital emissions in a given area to get insights into what makes wildfire emissions so deadly.\n",
      "27. “In order to be able to better test these hypotheses, we need these federally funded monitors and networks and data,” Benmarhnia said. “This is critical. Without that, it would be impossible to do this type of research and better understand what is going on.”\n",

      "TITLE: Funding for further EHR deployments ‘vitally important,’ VA secretary says\n",
      "AUTHOR: Edward Graham\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "1. Fully deploying the Department of Veterans Affairs’ new electronic health record system is necessary for streamlining veteran care and retaining clinicians, VA Secretary Doug Collins told members of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies on Tuesday.\n",
      "2. VA first signed a $10 billion contract — later revised to over $16 billion — with Cerner in May 2018 to modernize its legacy health record system and make it interoperable with the Pentagon’s new health record, which was also provided by Cerner. Oracle later acquired Cerner in 2022 and rebranded the new unit as Oracle Health.\n",
      "3. Problems with VA’s EHR software arose, however, almost as soon as it was first rolled out in 2020 at the Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center in Spokane, Washington. Patient safety concerns, performance glitches and usability challenges plagued the system, leading to VA paused the modernization project in April 2023 until it could address problems at the sites where the software had been deployed. As of this month, the new EHR system has been implemented at just six of VA’s 170 medical centers.\n",
      "4. VA announced in December that it was moving out of its operational pause and planned to roll out the new system at four Michigan-based medical sites in mid-2026. Collins subsequently announced in March that the department was planning to deploy the software at nine additional medical facilities next year, bringing the total to 13 sites.\n",
      "5. During Tuesday’s hearing on VA’s fiscal year 2026 budget, Collins told lawmakers that VA’s continued use of its current EHR system — the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture, or VistA — affects the retention of healthcare professionals across the agency’s operations. VistA runs on a programming language called MUMPS that some have argued is outdated.\n",
      "6. “You're using a system that's costing us literally hundreds of millions of dollars, that's used nowhere else in the world except the VA,” Collins said, alluding to VistA. “So we need to move forward on this [modernization effort].”\n",
      "7. He said VA has also worked to streamline engagement with their Oracle Health counterparts and to promote standardization across the sites using the new EHR software and added that “we had about a 10% gap to where VA would have our uniqueness [in coding].”\n",
      "8. Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich. — who noted that four of next year’s planned site rollouts are located in his state — called the EHR modernization project “a complex endeavor” and pressed Collins about how he would ensure that future software deployments are not beset by additional outages, slowdowns and disruptions.\n",
      "9. “That's why the funding for this is so vitally important,” Collins said. “Because I can't emphasize enough, if we do not transform this system, it hurts our community care process because our doctors cannot communicate with the community [or] our doctors internally.”\n",
      "10. The Trump administration’s FY26 budget proposal —released on May 2 — requests $3.5 billion overall for the deployment of the new EHR system, which represents a roughly $2.2 billion boost over the agency’s FY25 ask for the project.\n",
      "11. Collins told lawmakers last month that he hopes successful rollouts of the system next year will lead to faster rollouts moving forward, with a goal of “probably the addition of 20 to 25 more” deployments at medical facilities in fiscal year 2027.\n",
      "12. Last week, VA Deputy Secretary Paul Lawrence touted the progress the agency was already making ahead of next year’s planned rollouts and said deployment activities were already occurring at 11 of the 13 sites. He said VA was planning to begin activities at the two remaining facilities by the end of the month, and that the agency was hoping to fully implement the system at every VA medical facility by 2031.\n",
      "13. Peters noted that surveys conducted during VA’s operational pause showed that efforts to right the modernization project were on track, with the number of system interruptions affecting clinicians decreasing, while veteran trust in the facilities where the system had been deployed was increasing. But he still expressed some concern about plans to restart deployments, given previous problems with the initiative.\n",
      "14. “We do want to have more efficiency, but you have to make sure we don't have undue disruptions,” Peters cautioned.\n",

      "TITLE: Lawmakers spar over DOGE as Republicans look to lock in cuts\n",
      "AUTHOR: Natalie Alms\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "1. Republicans and Democrats traded jabs on Tuesday over the work of the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency during a DOGE subcommittee hearing.\n",
      "2. “We need to lock in DOGE savings for the taxpayers, and we should also be thinking about locking in the DOGE process that has produced these savings,” said Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., the head of the House Committee Oversight and Government Reform’s DOGE subcommittee, saying that the government is like an “overgrown, out-of-control animal.”\n",
      "3. Trump set up DOGE on his first day in office with a purported focus on tech, cost savings and efficiency, although since then the group’s efforts have been wide-ranging, including effectively shutting down entire agencies. Cost savings from the effort have fallen far short of Musk’s trillion-dollar goal, and DOGE’s public tally of cost savings has been riddled with errors. Critics say the unit's work has actually made many government processes less efficient.\n",
      "4. Billionaire Elon Musk stepped back from DOGE weeks ago, but the office’s associates remain dispersed across agencies. The administration is also seeking $45 million in funding for DOGE next year.\n",
      "5. “To win this war, we need to make sure these cuts aren’t just temporary,” said Greene. “That means passing laws to streamline agencies, eliminate redundant programs and give the president the authority to fire bureaucrats who don’t do their jobs.”\n",
      "6. Republican lawmakers are trying to push through a $9 billion rescission package that they say is meant to cement DOGE priorities with cuts to foreign aid and public broadcasting. They’re also up against a looming July 4 goal to pass a tax and spending reconciliation package to extend and expand tax cuts and enact priorities like immigration enforcement. Democrats noted that such a package is projected to add to the deficit .\n",
      "7. Democrats pushed back on the premise that DOGE is about efficiencies or savings.\n",
      "8. “All of this talk about lowering costs and reducing waste is absolute BS. Their agenda is about one thing: making the federal government so weak that they can exploit it for their personal gain,” said Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, who tried to subpoena Musk during the hearing. Republicans blocked the request, as they have with previous attempts.\n",
      "9. Greene said that DOGE is working to reduce waste, fraud and abuse. But since January, the Trump administration has fired many inspectors general, whose job it is to fight waste, fraud and abuse in agencies, despite the White House’s purported focus on those issues.\n",
      "10. “We came to the table at the beginning of this whole process in good faith with real ideas, bipartisan ideas, that folks have been working on for years and a desire to actually fix and modernize the federal government, what we've seen from DOGE is the exact opposite,” said the top Democrat on the subcommittee, Rep. Melanie Stansbury, D-N.M.\n",
      "11. “We all agree the government should be more efficient. We all agree that we should cut waste. We all agree that there should be bipartisan pathways forward to make the government operate in a modern manner,” Stansbury added. “But that's not what this enterprise is all about.”\n",
      "12. Some Democrats —and their witness Emily DiVito of the Groundwork Collaborative, an economic policy think tank — pointed to Social Security as an example of the negative impact of DOGE. The Trump administration is pushing to shrink its workforce by thousands, and SSA has been at the center of headlines for customer service problems.\n",
      "13. In May, the agency reversed an anti-fraud policy that slowed down retirement processing after it found essentially no fraud . It was put in place after DOGE and White House leaders repeated false claims about fraud levels on SSA phone lines.\n",
      "14. “[DOGE has] led to poor services, a brain drain on our federal government, and it’s going to cost taxpayers money long term,” said Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Va.\n",

      "TITLE: National Parks scramble to fill top leadership positions, but fix could create more vacancies\n",
      "AUTHOR: Eric Katz\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "1. The National Park Service is scrambling to fill top-level leadership positions at posts throughout the country, launching a new initiative to fill dozens of vacant roles that some inside the agency fear will only create new openings at other sites.\n",
      "2. Dubbed “Operation Opportunity,” NPS is soliciting applications for openings at the superintendent, deputy superintendent and chief of facilities level at a variety of park locations. Due to an ongoing governmentwide hiring freeze, however, the positions are only open to internal applicants within the Interior Department.\n",
      "3. That will limit those qualified for the lateral moves to employees already working in similar roles, according to a source involved in the initiative, meaning anyone who takes one of the jobs would be very likely creating a similar vacancy elsewhere within NPS. The vacancies currently being filled have been deemed high priority positions and are categorized at or among the top ranks of the civil service.\n",
      "4. Among the open positions are the superintendents for the National Parks of Big Bend, Glacier Bay and White Sands, the deputy superintendent for Glacier and Indiana Dunes and the chief of facilities at Yosemite. The list includes top openings at a myriad of additional national historic and other NPS sites, such as Martin Luther King National Historic Park in Atlanta.\n",
      "5. The number of vacancies among the top ranks at parks is expected to grow once those who accepted “deferred resignations”—and are currently sitting on administrative leave through September—are officially off the rolls.\n",
      "6. The source familiar with the initiative voiced concern that due to the nature of the internal postings—Operation Opportunity is open only for “lateral reassignments\"—the only people who would be qualified are those “who are at the level and already have the experience.” If they are accepted into the positions, their existing roles would then become vacant. Operation Opportunity originally launched in April, but agency leadership has “chaotically” asked HR to quickly post the dozens of park leadership positions. The urgency of the directive reflected a newfound pressure to fill the roles, the source said.\n",
      "7. An Interior spokesperson said Government Executive was seeking to \"skew the creation of new job opportunities for the American people.\"\n",
      "8. \"The department is thrilled to be posting and filling new positions at our treasured national parks,\" the spokesperson said. \"This administration is committed to expanding the workforce and investing in our beautiful parks - which are open and ready to visit!\"\n",
      "9. The agency is also dealing with staffing issues at the rank-and-file level. As of last month, the National Parks Conservation Association found NPS staffing was down 13% overall since President Trump took office. It also found that while Burgum pledged to hire as many as 7,700 seasonal employees for the peak summer season, NPS had onboarded just 3,300. That hiring was delayed as seasonal staff were initially subject to the hiring freeze . NPCA found there were around 100 total vacant superintendent positions.\n",
      "10. The source familiar with the initiative noted that seasonal hiring has been hampered by Trump administration policies.\n",
      "11. “Positions which were super easy to fill last year have had bone dry applicant pools and tons of declinations because people are scared to take a federal job,” the source said, or because they “don’t want to work for this administration.”\n",
      "12. The agency is also expected to lay off around 1,500 employees if the Supreme Court allows the Trump administration to move forward with its planned reductions in force, though Burgum has insisted the cuts will not impact park operations and has demanded that no park can reduce its hours or services without headquarters approval.\n",
      "13. During congressional testimony earlier this month, Burgum reiterated to lawmakers that layoffs would not affect parks and said superintendent openings were being filled on a temporary basis.\n",
      "14. “We're trying to cut jobs that aren't in parks,” the secretary said to Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colo. “And if there's a vacancy to superintendent [positions], we fill it with the deputy. So it's incorrect for you to say that we have—we have vacancies because when a superintendent takes early retirement, superintendents are at the end of their career.”\n",
      "15. Theresa Pierno, NPCA’s president, said Burgum was being dishonest in his testimony.\n",
      "16. “Secretary Burgum’s narrative doesn’t match the reality unfolding in our parks,” Pierno said. “The Park Service is in a full-blown staffing crisis.\n",

      "1. Two senators on the panel overseeing the Department of Veterans Affairs are pressing the agency’s inspector general to probe VA’s mass contract cancellations and the role that artificial intelligence played in determining the agreements that would be terminated.\n",
      "2. In a June 13-dated letter to VA Inspector General David Case that was publicly released on Monday, Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Angus King, I-Maine, called for the agency watchdog to review the hundreds of VA contracts cancelled by the Department of Government Efficiency since the start of the Trump administration.\n",
      "3. Blumenthal is the ranking member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, and King is also a member of the committee.\n",
      "4. In line with DOGE’s cost-cutting efforts, VA Secretary Doug Collins has announced that the agency is looking at letting go of as many as 83,000 employees across its operations this year to return to its 2019 staffing levels. Collins similarly announced in March that VA was cancelling “585 non-mission-critical or duplicative contracts,” with plans to cancel additional agreements as the agency continued its review.\n",
      "5. In both instances, Collins stressed that the efforts are designed to streamline VA’s operations and to limit unnecessary spending, and that they would not affect mission-critical programs.\n",
      "6. The lawmakers — who wrote that VA has cancelled over 650 contracts through the end of May — said, however, that a preliminary review of the terminated agreements found that “a majority appear to be for services directly for veterans or critical VA operations to include for safe health care delivery,” and that it also seemed as though the agency did not perform the necessary planning needed before undertaking the mass cancellations.\n",
      "7. They also cited a June 6 ProPublica investigation “that found evidence that DOGE and VA officials used ill-conceived Artificial Intelligence (AI) formulas and algorithms to make or inform contract cancellation decisions — cutting out meaningful input from VA career experts to assess the impact of ending these services.”\n",
      "8. Blumenthal similarly pointed to the news report about the use of AI during a Democrat-only June 10 spotlight forum , saying at the time that he supported cutting waste at VA but that “the way to focus on it is thoughtfully and factually, not to use AI and identify keywords in the contract that then result in wholesale slashing.”\n",
      "9. The two lawmakers said the use of AI to identify contracts for termination “adds an entire new level of unease connected to the decision-making, security, governance, and quality control of the entire process.”\n",
      "10. In an interview with ProPublica, the DOGE employee who created the AI tool that was used to identify contracts for “munching” — or cancellation — at VA told the outlet that “ mistakes were made ” by his program. He also said that analyzing VA’s nearly 90,000 contracts within the 30-day period outlined by President Donald Trump’s February executive order mandating such a review of agencies’ “spending on contracts, grants and loans” would have been impossible without developing the AI tool.\n",
      "11. In addition to pressing the IG to investigate the impact of the cancelled contracts on veterans and VA as a whole, Blumenthal and King also requested that the watchdog look into “the use of AI and/or algorithms to guide decision-making to include the recipient and purpose” of each VA contract identified for termination.\n",
      "12. The lawmakers also asked that the IG review “the formal assignment and instructions given” to the DOGE employee to determine if they included the use of AI, as well as look into whether there were data privacy safeguards in place for the contract information run through the AI tool and “the extent to which this and any other related use of AI by DOGE or the VA violated any policy, procedure, regulation, or statute.”\n",

      "1. Almost as soon as Dr. Laura Cheever found out that she was being honored for her decades of leadership at the Health and Human Services Department, she thought it was somewhat peculiar to be receiving an individual recognition.\n",
      "2. “When they first called…they said, ‘We want you to talk to us about what you did,” Cheever recalled. “I think that to be successful in government you have to be able to work well in teams and to collaborate and to see possibilities and partnerships.”\n",
      "3. Cheever is one of 23 current and former federal employees who received a 2025 Samuel J. Heyman Service to America medal (Sammie), an awards program that the Partnership for Public Service has sponsored since 2002 for outstanding civil servants. This year, however, the nonpartisan good government group had to contend with the Trump administration’s cuts to agency workforces and efforts to weaken the independence of the civil service.\n",
      "4. “I was really, one, honored to have received an award, and, two, really pleased that they were able to find a way to do it,” Cheever said.\n",
      "5. While she is nearly six months into a “long-planned retirement” that was “not related to elections,” Cheever spent more than two decades leading the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program , which provides medical and other support to low-income people with HIV and annually assists more than half of all people in the U.S. with HIV, estimated at about 500,000 individuals.\n",
      "6. Her involvement with treating HIV began while she was doing medical training in San Francisco in the 1990s. She then moved to Baltimore for similar work during which time medicines started emerging that stopped an HIV diagnosis from automatically meaning a death sentence.\n",
      "7. “I was very interested in making sure that as many people as possible could get started on these medications as quickly as possible,” Cheever said. “I saw that working for the federal government, I would be able to really increase that impact exponentially, and that's why I went to work for the federal government from a position that I loved in academia.”\n",
      "8. At the end of 2024, HHS announced that a record-breaking 90.6% of individuals with HIV receiving medical care through Ryan White were virally suppressed, meaning they are on medication that prevents sexual transmission of the virus. This is a roughly 20% increase from 2010 and higher than the national viral suppression rate of 65%.\n",
      "9. Cheever is worried, however, that proposed cuts to public health care funding in congressional Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act (H.R. 1) and the Trump administration’s anti-LGBTQ+ policies could impede that progress.\n",
      "10. “If Medicaid or Medicare were to drastically be reduced or otherwise cut people off from being able to access care, or people are scared to come to care because they are transgender or gay or whatever those issues are going to be for people in this current environment, that is what makes me very, very concerned about the nation as a whole making progress,” she said.\n",
      "11. She’s also apprehensive about the ability of agencies to bring on top-tier talent in the future.\n",
      "12. “I've recruited many, many very talented people to come into federal government, and I've been able to tell them, quite honestly, that in every administration I've worked in, Democrat, Republican, all sorts of different people, we always had amazing opportunities to pursue our work. We had to shift the work, but our core mission and values really had not changed over time,” she said. “I'm not sure I could tell that to people today.”\n",
      "13. Agency financial, performance report writers get their moment in the spotlight\n",
      "14. Another 2025 honoree — Richard Burns , a project manager at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center — was recognized for leading the team behind OSIRIS-REx, a spacecraft that brought back the largest asteroid sample to Earth.\n",
      "15. Studies on that sample have found molecules that are key to life, suggesting, according to NASA , that “the conditions necessary for the emergence of life were widespread across the early solar system [and] increasing the odds life could have formed on other planets and moons.”\n",
      "16. As such, Burns said he gets a lot of questions about aliens.\n",
      "17. “It’s not unreasonable. One of the points of OSIRIS-REx was to investigate the composition of these primitive asteroids to ascertain whether they contain the ingredients for life,” he said. “It answers key questions in how did life originate.”\n",
      "18. But to reach that discovery, Burns and his team faced a barrage of complications.\n",
      "19. “OSIRIS-REx was really just a series of crises once we got to the asteroid,” he said.\n",
      "20. The asteroid Bennu had an unexpectedly rugged surface, which created difficulties for landing. The spacecraft also collected too much rock, which briefly prevented the lid on its sample collection capsule from closing. And when it returned to Earth, one of its two parachutes didn’t work.\n",
      "21. “The first parachute didn't open. There was a lot of tension in the sample return event,” he said. “The main parachute did open and deployed successfully, and everything was okay in the end because the system was designed robustly.”\n",
      "22. Still, Burns said there were many celebratory “fist in the air moments.”\n",
      "23. “We had lots of moments where we celebrated pretty good, but always knowing the race wasn't won yet,” he said. “Finally, when we got the sample mass we knew that we had accomplished what we had set out to do.”\n",
      "24. Overcoming obstacles, however, is why Burns argues individuals should want to work for NASA.\n",

      "TITLE: Most fed-targeting provisions in Senate reconciliation bill don’t pass Byrd muster\n",
      "AUTHOR: Erich Wagner\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "1. A series of plans targeting federal workers’ retirement benefits, their unions and civil service protections were dealt a setback over the weekend when the Senate parliamentarian warned that they violate rules governing budget reconciliation initiatives.\n",
      "2. Last week, Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Rand Paul, R-Ky., unveiled his panel’s portion of congressional Republicans’ budget reconciliation package, which aims to reduce federal spending to partially pay for extended tax cuts for the ultrawealthy and increased immigration enforcement. The measure abandoned a series of House-passed proposals to cut the retirement benefits of currently serving federal workers but would have required future federal hires to pay nearly 15% of their paychecks toward their retirement benefits if they wished to accrue civil service protections.\n",
      "3. But Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., top Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, announced Sunday that the Senate parliamentarian had ruled that most of the Senate’s proposals governing federal benefits and workforce policies violated the Byrd rule, which aims to limit reconciliation measure—and its simple majority threshold for passage—to topics that are budgetary in nature.\n",
      "4. “There is no better way to define this big beautiful betrayal of a bill than families lose and billionaires win,” he said. “Democrats are on the side of families and workers and are scrutinizing this bill piece by piece to ensure Republicans can’t use the reconciliation process to force their anti-worker policies on the American people. The Byrd Rule is enshrined in law for a reason, and Democrats are making sure it is enforced.”\n",
      "5. Provisions that would require a 60-vote majority to advance include the plan to require all new federal employees to pay 9.4% toward the Federal Employees Retirement System and to choose between paying an additional 5 percentage points toward FERS or serving as at-will employees; a requirement that federal employees challenging an adverse action before the Merit Systems Protection Board pay a $350 filing fee, as well as a proposal to charge federal employee unions for use of agency property and official time on a quarterly basis.\n",
      "6. The parliamentarian also said that a provision effectively giving the Trump administration “carte blanche” to reorganize federal agencies and lay off thousands of federal workers would similarly run afoul of the Byrd rule. Earlier this month, Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters that he would not consider overruling the parliamentarian as part of the bid to send the reconciliation package to President Trump’s desk by July 4.\n",
      "7. Still remaining in the package is a provision tasking the Office of Personnel Management with conducting an audit of enrollees in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program to ensure family members remain eligible as dependents, and a requirement that the government charge a 10% fee on deductions from federal workers paychecks, such as unions dues and charitable contributions as part of the Combined Federal Campaign.\n",
      "8. In a statement, National Treasury Employees Union National President Doreen Greenwald praised the rulings.\n",
      "9. “We are glad the Senate parliamentarian agreed that many of the harmful federal employee provisions contained in the draft budget reconciliation package were not a real attempt to save money, but instead an attempt to use the budget reconciliation process to make significant changes to civil service policies,” she said. “As this process continues to move forward, NTEU will keep up the fight to protect employee pay, benefits and workforce rights from those who are determined to harm frontline federal employees around the country who work hard every day to serve the American people, and to weaken the unions that represent them.”\n",

      "[9/20] Processing: OPM’s new performance management rules are (mostly) spot on\n",
      "TITLE: OPM’s new performance management rules are (mostly) spot on\n",
      "AUTHOR: Ronald Sanders\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "1. The Office of Personnel Management has just issued detailed new requirements for agency performance management systems, and while I will take issue with some of the details on technical and policy grounds—especially anything that even hints at political partisanship—I think they’re a step in the right direction, especially insofar as they take on things like the perennial problem of inflated, “everybody gets a medal” annual performance ratings.\n",
      "2. Yes, those new rules are incredibly detailed, particularly if they’re intended as the “be all and end all” of federal performance management. As promulgated, they leave little to no room for federal agencies to field systems that are equally rigorous but better reflect their different missions and cultures. Thus, the new rules may be construed as “one size fits all” in that regard. I hope I’m wrong, because if they work as clearly intended—that is, by setting a governmentwide floor for this year’s performance cycle and beyond—they needn’t be.\n",
      "3. More agency realism and the ‘floor’ established by OPM\n",
      "4. If the new standards are intended as “the minimum daily adult requirement” for performance evaluation—one that brings sorely needed rigor and realism to a critical management activity that unfortunately, has lapsed—then they’re a net positive. And I would argue that like a spoonful of castor oil, they’re necessary. Too many agencies have surrendered when it comes to the real burdens and return on investment of performance management, opting to make the process so simple as to become largely irrelevant, a necessary evil required by law, as in, “Okay, if we have to do it, let’s make it as painless as possible.” To me, that looks too much like waving a white flag.\n",
      "5. Take so-called “pass-fail” systems. OPM’s new rules ban them, and that couldn’t come fast enough. Under such systems (and they’ve proliferated), almost no one fails and virtually everyone passes. I don’t know if our civil servants are that good, but I do think that most employees don’t really like pass-fail, as they allow managers to avoid making often-difficult distinctions in employee performance. Even though everyone knows they exist (especially the employees themselves).\n",
      "6. The fact is that employees perform at different levels, the result of a whole host of factors like training, fit, ability, motivation, work habits, distractions at home (and work) and yes, just plain old bureaucracy...inefficiencies that have festered over the years. But that doesn’t mean surrender. Just the opposite!\n",
      "7. Maybe we’ve lapsed because the stakes are so low. When it comes to pay, an employee’s compensation is basically on automatic pilot (even the Government Accountability Office says so!), a function of the time clock and a pulse. Seniority and survival prevail over high performance, at least to date. And while OPM’s new standards attempt to use current law to reward that high performance, the fact is that the decades-old General Schedule was just not built to do so.\n",
      "8. Requiring (often hard) performance distinctions is a good thing\n",
      "9. Or maybe it’s because we don’t invest in and support our managers when they make those difficult distinctions. That too needs to be addressed, but at the agency level. With some exceptions, like the now semi-permanent Acquisition and Lab “Demonstration Projects” in DOD, performance distinctions made by managers have no real consequences, so it’s no wonder that many of them just don’t bother to make those distinctions.\n",
      "10. I don’t blame them—we’ve given them too much to do and not enough training to do it—but at the same time, that doesn’t mean we need to accept that everyone’s performance is the same and should therefore receive the same (typically inflated) rating. That’s just not true and getting real when it comes to annual ratings is worth tackling.\n",
      "11. That also applies to retention, and OPM gets credit for tilting at that windmill too. Today, retention is pretty much automatic. Non-probationary employees almost always get a job for life and then receive as much as a 35% increase in salary—from Step 1 to Step 10 in the GS system—just by virtue of patience, pulse and an “acceptable level of competence” (whatever that means).\n",
      "12. Some (hopefully many) employees may really be motivated by public service and do not care about performance, pay and/or retention distinctions, but my own experience says otherwise.\n",
      "13. Equity theory says performance distinctions matter\n",
      "14. You see, I’m a proponent of ‘equity theory’ when it comes to motivation. It says that one pays close attention to the efforts of one’s co-workers, what they “give” on the job and what they “get” for it in return. It suggests that employees will adjust their efforts up or down to ensure “equity.” But in my cynical experience, if an idealistic, high performing “baby” civil servant sees more seasoned co-workers just punching the time clock, that person will eventually do the same. After all, it’s just not worth the extra effort, at least so says equity theory.\n",
      "15. Of course, I’m generalizing, as workers are motivated by a whole host of things. But the decades-old GS system generalizes too. When its rules explicitly say that time-in-grade matters above all else, many employees will behave that way. That does not mean that they or their peers do not (or did not) have what Jim Perry calls “public service motivation” but the weight of that system, permeating every aspect of one’s working life, may eventually dull if not destroy that intrinsic motivation.\n",
      "16. Among other things, one way to combat that resultant apathy is to focus on performance management, both day-to-day and over time, and OPM’s attempt to control ratings inflation, as well as to ban pass-fail systems, are both good. Not easy. But good. Many of today’s performance appraisal systems just ooze mediocrity. They implicitly (and unintentionally?) encourage and reward it, and while that mediocrity may be okay for some, I think American citizens, as well as most federal civil servants, have soundly rejected that notion.\n",
      "17. Thus, I think employees actually want managers to make performance distinctions (their own, as well as peers’), so long as they’re seen as fair and accurate. Achieving that has always been the challenge, but that’s a problem worth spending some time on. What’s not are pass-fail systems that simply give up and say all employees are alike when it comes to their performance, when everyone knows that they are not.\n",
      "18. We need more accountability, not less\n",
      "19. A quick word about my friend Erich Wagner’s excellent story in Government Executive on this subject, in which an anonymous HR director is quoted as saying the new rules ignore two harsh realities: the current system’s lack of pay consequences, and its impact on RIFs. I agree with that assessment, but in contrast to that unnamed source, I think that impact is a net positive.\n",
      "20. I’ve already talked about the need to make individual performance and pay distinctions matter, but there are problems with the governmentwide system that need fixing too. Thus, while governmentwide pay “comparability” has been a problem for the federal civil service almost since its inception (for example how do you value tangible benefits like pensions?), tackling that problem—perhaps by modernizing the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act—is also something we seem to be avoiding.\n",
      "21. I didn’t do so when I chaired the Federal Salary Council, but my efforts to “reform” that law (and fully fund those government agencies that implement it) largely fell on deaf ears. It’s just too convenient to rail in the media about the seemingly intractable but in my view, mythical “pay gap” between federal and non-federal employees, rather than try to reduce it through methodological fixes like more occupational differentiation (something the labor market does as a matter of course), vs. paying some far more than the market says they deserve...and some far less.\n",
      "22. Erich’s unnamed source also suggested that the new rules will have an impact on RIF. I agree, but for good reasons, not bad. The performance management system should make more performance distinctions when we run a RIF, not less! Indeed, I think performance distinctions, if meaningful, ought to be determinative when an agency retrenches. But like so many other things, that too has become irrelevant. We should want to retain our best, highest performers—not our most senior ones—when we RIF and I hope the “new” OPM encourages agencies to do so.\n",
      "23. Bottom line: Give OPM an ‘A’ for effort...but with some caveats\n",
      "24. The bottom line here is that OPM’s new standards are pretty good, especially if you 1. shed any hint of political partisanship—we haven’t talked about that, but I’d refer you to Erich’s article, as it does a good job of pointing those out in order to preserve a nonpartisan civil service—2. back off of any plug for forced ratings distribution, in favor of more realism and—3. allow for more stringent, agency-based systems that better reflect government’s variety of missions and measures.\n",
      "25. But as I said above, I’m old school in that regard, as well as a naively optimistic “glass half full” person, and I will always argue that we should keep and reward our very best civil servants, even if that’s hard! So, the new OPM rules, especially if clarified as I hope, are a step in the right direction. Now, if only there are people still willing to come work for the federal government, after all the DOGE carnage and talk about “throat slashing.” But that’s another matter.\n",

      "AUTHOR: David DiMolfetta\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "1. Iran-linked hackers and other groups affiliated with Tehran will likely launch cyberattacks against U.S. targets in response to President Donald Trump’s order to strike three of Iran’s nuclear sites, according to a Department of Homeland Security bulletin issued Sunday.\n",
      "2. “Low-level cyber attacks against U.S. networks by pro-Iranian hacktivists are likely, and cyber actors affiliated with the Iranian government may conduct attacks against U.S. networks,” said the alert from the National Terrorism Advisory System.\n",
      "3. The notice, scheduled to expire Sept. 22, adds that “hacktivists and Iranian government-affiliated actors routinely target poorly secured U.S. networks and internet-connected devices for disruptive cyber attacks.”\n",
      "4. Under orders from Trump, U.S. bombers struck the Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan nuclear facilities in Iran on Saturday night, escalating a yearslong tension between the two nations that occurred amid back and forth talks seeking to deter Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Just over a week ago, Israel launched its own incursion against Iranian military officials and scientists, on grounds that Iran was closer than ever before to having nuclear weapon capabilities.\n",
      "5. The aim of the strikes was to destroy “Iran’s nuclear enrichment capacity” and eliminate “the nuclear threat posed by the world’s No. 1 state sponsor of terror,” Trump said Saturday night. “The strikes were a spectacular military success.”\n",
      "6. The NTAS bulletin reflects years of observed Iranian cyberattacks targeting U.S. systems. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’s Cyber-Electronic Command and the affiliated “Cyber Av3ngers” gang were found to have breached U.S. water infrastructure in late 2023 in response to Israel’s war against Hamas.\n",
      "7. During the 2024 election cycle, the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency concluded that Iran stole sensitive documents from the Trump campaign and floated them to the media with the hope that they’d be published online.\n",
      "8. Iranian hackers tend to launch distributed denial of service attacks — designed to overwhelm a webpage with bot traffic until the page crashes — against aerospace, oil, gas and telecommunications entities, Brian Harrell, a former DHS assistant secretary who served in Trump’s first term, said in a statement to Nextgov/FCW .\n",
      "9. An Iranian hacker group on Sunday claimed responsibility for temporarily shuttering Truth Social, Trump’s signature social media platform. The denial of service attack occurred just after Trump announced the strikes on the nuclear targets.\n",
      "10. “Iran’s cyber strategy is likely [in] cooperation with Russia, which given current tensions, could be a real possibility. Iranian capabilities have certainly increased since the ‘Shamoon’ attacks used against oil companies back in the day,” added Harrell, referring to the 2012 virus that crippled some 30,000 computers at major energy providers.\n",
      "11. Iranian spin doctors have been found using artificial intelligence tools to spread disinformation in the U.S. and other nations. An OpenAI blog published last summer disclosed a covert campaign involving fake news websites aimed at influencing American voters, though, according to the company, the effort failed to gain significant engagement.\n",
      "12. On Friday, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a D.C.-based national security think tank, uncovered an Iranian network built to help scammers impersonate Israelis on social media and post demoralizing messages in Hebrew.\n",
      "13. “Iran has several highly-capable teams for offensive cyber operations. U.S.-based organizations should maintain vigilance and accelerate their defensive operational tempos in anticipation of retaliation,” said an industry executive with knowledge of Iranian cyber capabilities, who was granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n",
      "14. The Sunday bulletin also warned of potential physical threats inside the U.S. originating from foreign terrorist organizations or extremist groups, including calls for retaliatory violence and the targeting of people critical of Iran’s central government.\n",
      "15. “The conflict could also motivate violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators seeking to attack targets perceived to be Jewish, pro-Israel or linked to the US government or military in the homeland,” it adds.\n",
      "16. A pro-Israel hacking group said Wednesday it drained over $90 million from Iran’s largest crypto exchange, Nobitex, in the latest breach of the country’s financial networks. The group, known as Predatory Sparrow, also claimed responsibility for an earlier attack on Bank Sepah.\n",
      "17. Editor's note: This article has been updated to include mention of an Iranian-aligned hacktivist group's claim that it temporarily knocked the Truth Social platform offline.\n",

      "AUTHOR: Erich Wagner\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "1. The Office of Personnel Management this week released new guidance calling on federal agencies to rate fewer employees as above average or outstanding and to discipline or fire federal workers more quickly.\n",
      "2. Much like OPM’s hiring plan , a new memo from acting OPM Director Charles Ezell to agency heads makes overtures toward the nonpartisan issue of improving performance management in government, but introduces partisan elements that could threaten the effectiveness of those reforms, experts say.\n",
      "3. “For many decades now, performance management across the federal workforce has fallen short of what the American people should expect,” Ezell wrote. “Too often, this has resulted in a lack of accountability and inflated performance ratings. Federal employee performance ratings should be normalized and reflect individual contributions to organizational results and outcomes.”\n",
      "4. To alleviate this, OPM instructed agencies to revise the annual performance plans of federal workers to better delineate between the “fully successful,” “exceeds fully successful” and “outstanding” performance ratings, as well as link an individual’s responsibilities with agency mission delivery. But language in the memo also appears to allude to agencies exploring forced distribution of ratings, which OPM has already moved to adopt for members of the Senior Executive Service , while another provision mandates that performance plans be linked specifically to “Trump administration priorities.”\n",
      "5. A former federal HR official told Government Executive that while they agreed with the need to address performance inflation, two of the primary causes of that phenomenon—low or no across-the-board federal pay raises , and the threat of reductions in force—show no sign of going away any time soon.\n",
      "6. “We already tie bonuses to your ratings, and a lot of the time that’s the only way for a supervisor to give a little bit more money to staff members that they want to recognize and try and retain,” the official said. “Until [former President] Biden came into office and issued one decent pay raise, the prior 10 years were abysmal, starting with Obama in 2013 with sequestration.”\n",
      "7. The memo also calls on agencies to make better use of firing and disciplinary authorities, as well as to shorten performance improvement plans to 30 days. But much of the reforms are rooted in improving training for supervisors and better communication between managers and frontline workers, and it remains to be seen how that would be paid for or administered, particularly after OPM shuttered the Federal Executive Institute in February.\n",
      "8. “They talk about the importance of training, which is an excellent idea, but it’s not clear where it’s going to come from or who is going to pay for it,” said Don Kettl, professor emeritus and former dean of the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. “In the case of any downsizing in government, training is always the first to go. So is there going to be investment to try to make happen what they’re proposing?”\n",
      "9. The former HR official said the plan to reduce performance improvement plans to 30 days belies the overall memo as a “red herring.”\n",
      "10. “If you can’t articulate why someone’s failing and you only give them 30 days to show that they’re no longer failing, it becomes a procedural widget to sustain a termination,” they said. “[And] the Trump administration has done such a thorough job in the last five months cutting the balls off of unions—which is a mistake, because they help provide due process—and the Merit Systems Protection Board, the [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] and [Office of Special Counsel], it’s going to be hard for current employees under these constraints to win anything.”\n",
      "11. Kettl said that the running theme of the Trump administration’s workforce policy—proposing needed reforms along with politicization efforts that undermine them—seems rooted in a fundamental mistrust of career employees.\n",
      "12. “There’s an old saying: ‘There are two ways that a civil servant can undermine a political appointee: One is to do nothing of what they say, and the other is to do everything that they say,’” he said. “The people who come in with ideas about what ought to happen and what policy ought to be always benefit from the expertise of those who have been doing it a long time, and you can see it reflected in this document. I can see what they’re trying to do, but it would benefit from the people who actually do the work giving it a once-over.”\n",

      "AUTHOR: Sean Michael Newhouse\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "1. Senior Democrats in a letter on Wednesday objected to Education Department plans to largely transfer responsibility over certain grant programs to the Labor Department, arguing the move represents another attempt to eliminate the agency without congressional approval.\n",
      "2. According to court documents , the departments on May 21 entered into an interagency agreement under which Labor would take over administration of career and technical education assistance grants under the 2006 Perkins Act as well as Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Title II grants for adult literacy and education programs.\n",
      "3. In their letter to Education Secretary Linda McMahon, the lawmakers wrote that the department lacks the authority to mostly hand over control over the programs, which would involve a transfer of up to $2.7 billion in fiscal 2025 alone.\n",
      "4. “Respectfully, federal agencies are not interchangeable entities that simply hand out money to states and localities,” they wrote. “Instead, each agency provides its own specific expertise in the administration of federal programs, in this case education programs.”\n",
      "5. The letter was signed by Senate Appropriations Committee vice chair Patty Murray, D-Wash., Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies ranking member Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., House Education and Workforce Committee ranking member Bobby Scott, D-Va., and House Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn.\n",
      "6. The members of Congress also expressed frustration that they were not notified about the interagency agreements and predicted that incorporating another department into the programs’ operations would lead to inefficiencies.\n",
      "7. “This likely would mean states, institutions of higher education and school districts would have to work with two federal agencies in the administration of these programs, leading to delays in agency decision-making and grant administration,” they contended.\n",
      "8. The interagency agreement is currently on hold due to an injunction that required Education to bring back its employees who were laid off under reduction-in-force procedures. Education Chief of Staff Rachel Oglesby wrote in a June 10 court filing that the injunction was preventing the agency from “pursuing operational efficiencies and cost-savings.”\n",
      "9. Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications at Education, said in a statement to Government Executive that the agreement with Labor is “one of many existing agreements ED has with other agencies to collaborate on services for the American people.” She also said that the department would respond to the Democrats’ letter.\n",
      "10. President Donald Trump in March signed an executive order that requires the drawdown of the Education Department while still preserving many of its programs. Court documents also show that Education, prior to the injunction, was negotiating a memorandum of understanding through which employees would be detailed to the Treasury Department to work on student loan management.\n",

      "AUTHOR: Eric Katz\n",
      "CONTENT:\n",
      "1. The White House and its Department of Government Efficiency are spearheading efforts to shake up the Postal Service, according to details of the meetings obtained by Government Executive , with topics including pricing for mail and general reform proposals.\n",
      "2. The meetings were not clearly within the scope of a memorandum of understanding former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy signed with DOGE, which focused on specific cost-cutting measures and real estate planning. Some of the meetings also involved top officials from the Treasury Department, White House attorneys and policy advisors and additional USPS executives. A source familiar with the meetings confirmed DOGE has been active at the Postal Service’s Washington headquarters in recent months.\n",
      "3. The meetings began in late March, just days after DeJoy resigned amid pressure from the Trump administration. Acting Postmaster General Doug Tulino met with DOGE the day he was sworn into his new role to discuss ethics, according to details from the meeting. Two DOGE team members—Alex Simonpour and Ethan Shaotran, both of whom have MOUs of their own with USPS—were present, along with other postal executives.\n",
      "4. In April, Simonpour and Shaotran met again with Tulino and postal leaders, including Fiona Machado, USPS' director for pricing and costing strategy support. That was followed by another meeting with postal officials, including the new USPS Chief Financial Officer Luke Grossman, to discuss an exigent price increase. The Postal Service can request authority to implement rate hikes outside its normal price caps in emergency situations, which it has not done since 2013. USPS is set to raise the price of a stamp to 78 cents in July, which would mark a 42% increase over the last five years since DeJoy took office.\n",
      "5. In May, Clark Milner, a White House senior advisor for policy, organized a meeting with the DOGE, including James Burnham, its chief attorney, and members of the Domestic Policy Council. Among those in the policy team was James Sherk, an architect of the Trump administration’s initiatives to cut federal rolls and weaken protections afforded by civil service laws.\n",
      "6. Earlier this month, Sherk spearheaded a meeting with officials throughout the administration to discuss postal reform. Among the invitees were the chief of staff, the deputy assistant secretary and the assistant secretary for management at Treasury. Several White House attorneys, policy advisors and a representative from Vice President J.D. Vance’s office were also invited.\n",
      "7. In March, DeJoy sent a letter to lawmakers explaining that DOGE would only be authorized to work with his agency on matters related to USPS retirement plans, workers compensation costs, congressional liaisoning regarding costs incurred by legislative mandates, reforms to its regulatory requirements, retail lease renewals, business opportunities with other federal agencies and counterfeit postage.\n",
      "8. “These are the only initiatives that I have requested and authorized the DOGE team to assist on thus far, and only the data and information required to pursue these initiatives will be provided to the DOGE team members,” DeJoy said.\n",
      "9. While pricing matters and general reform were not included in that list, DeJoy mentioned the Postal Service’s regulator has stood in the way of “timely and necessary changes required to succeed as a self-funded enterprise.” All price hikes, including exigent increases, must receive approval from the Postal Regulatory Commission.\n",
      "10. The Postal Service declined to comment for this story. The White House and Treasury Department did not respond to multiple inquiries.\n",
      "11. David Steiner, a long-time CEO of Waste Management and FedEx board member, will take over as postmaster general in July. Mike Plunkett, long-time postal executive turned president of the Association for Postal Commerce, said it was surprising the current leadership team would be discussing such significant shakeups just two weeks before the organization swears in a new CEO. He added it would be difficult to justify an exigent price hike when the agnecy is already implementing a rate hike next month.\n",
      "12. Prior to taking office this year, Trump suggested he might seek to privatize USPS entirely —resurrecting a proposal from his first term . Trump said in February, however, that the Postal Service would continue to exist as a public entity even if it was no longer a standalone agency. Elon Musk, who until recently led DOGE’s efforts, subsequently said USPS should be privatized.\n",
      "13. Trump was considering signing an executive order to fold USPS into the Commerce Department, The Washington Post reported earlier this year, though that plan never came to fruition. Pierre Gentin, a senior advisor to Commerce Department Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trump's nominee to serve as the agency's general counsel, was invited to the June postal reform meeting.\n",

      "1. The Senate on Wednesday confirmed President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead Customs and Border Protection, a major role for carrying out the president’s border enforcement agenda and the handling of unauthorized migration.\n",
      "2. In a 51-46 party-line vote, the Senate confirmed Rodney Scott of Oklahoma.\n",
      "3. Scott previously served as the chief of the Border Patrol, an agency within CBP, during the first Trump administration and under former President Joe Biden.\n",
      "4. During the first Trump administration, Scott implemented a policy that required asylum-seekers to remain in Mexico while their cases were pending in immigration court.\n",
      "5. As the new head of CBP, Scott will oversee more than 60,000 employees. The agency also manages more than 300 ports of entry at borders, airports and seaports.\n",
      "6. During his Senate confirmation hearing in April, the Senate Finance Committee’s top Democrat, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, raised concerns about the 2010 death of an immigrant at a CBP station in San Diego that Scott ran.\n",
      "7. Anastasio Hernández Rojas was detained by CBP officers and was beaten, later dying from his injuries, Wyden said.\n",
      "8. “Rather than following the agency’s own policy and immediately referring the incident to outside investigators, the San Diego CBP office began its own investigation,” Wyden said. “In the course of that investigation, the CBP officers taped over the only video copy of Hernández Rojas’s death and tampered with physical evidence, according to court documents.”\n",
      "9. The United States paid $1 million to settle a lawsuit brought by Hernández Rojas’s widow, and in 2015 the Justice Department declined to pursue federal charges against any of the officers or leaders involved in the case.\n",
      "10. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sent a letter to the committee before Scott’s confirmation hearing and informed senators that the agency reviewed the 2010 incident and that Scott’s work “was in accordance with his duties, the law and professional standards.”\n",

      "2. That’s the stage we’ve set with the current debate on the merit system. The real debate between the Trump administration reformers and others in the battle is where they want to set the lever for merit system principles. If truth be told, no one—right, left, center—likes the current merit system.\n",

Some friends of mine have said they would set it at 1911, just before the passage of the Lloyd-LaFollette Act, at a time when merit determined the hiring of federal employees but when presidents had much more power to dismiss employees. Others have said 1945, before the GS classification system emerged. One experienced expert told me it would be 1977, before the 1978 reforms that, in the expert’s opinion, introduced the pathologies that make human resources managers so unhappy today. And, of course, some of my conservative friends would choose the current Trump action.\n",

      "1. A pair of President Donald Trump’s picks for agency inspectors general — Anthony D’Esposito for Labor and Cheryl Mason at the Veterans Affairs Department — have faced inquiries during their confirmation hearings in recent weeks from senators concerned about their ability to act independently from the administration.\n",
      "2. The pair are vying to replace former Labor and VA IGs, who, along with more than a dozen other agency watchdogs who investigate waste, fraud and abuse, were fired by Trump the first week of his second term. At the time, the president said: “I don’t know [the IGs]…but some people thought that some were unfair, some were not doing their job.”\n",
      "3. Both D’Esposito and Mason, testifying weeks apart, faced scrutiny due to their political support for the president and past roles working under Trump-appointed department secretaries.\n",
      "4. D’Esposito, a former New York Republican congressman, touted his law enforcement experience Wednesday during a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing and swore to visit every IG regional office.\n",
      "5. “I will travel to each of the regional offices and hear from the men and women on the ground to find out what is actually happening [and] what we can do better,” he said. “Quite frankly, I think they need to feel that they're heard and that they're believed in, and that would make it a more efficient and more productive inspector general's office.”\n",
      "6. D’Esposito also said that he would prioritize working with local police to combat child labor law violations, particularly as they relate to illegal immigration.\n",
      "7. Committee Chair Bill Cassidy, R-La., told D’Esposito that he had a “great background” for the role, but Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., said it was “concerning” that he wouldn’t commit to continuing open investigations that were initiated by the previous Labor IG without seeing them first.\n",
      "8. If confirmed, D’Esposito said he would lead the Labor IG office “without fear or favor.” Throughout the hearing, he said that this is a “golden age of the American worker,” which is a Trump slogan — although he argued that it is nonpartisan.\n",
      "9. Senators did not ask D'Esposito about past controversies, including a 2024 report from The New York Times that he may have violated House ethics rules by allegedly hiring his fiancee’s daughter as well as a woman with whom he was alleged to have had an affair.\n",
      "10. Democrats on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee criticized Mason during her June 4 hearing for her previous role as a senior advisor to VA Secretary Doug Collins, with ranking member Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., asserting the position made Mason unsuitable for a role providing oversight of the department.\n",
      "11. “You have been earning your pay as a loyal advisor, a member of the Collins team, an employee at his behest, a political appointee, not as a career civil servant,” Blumenthal said. “You are a political appointee as inspector general and that is why I will object to your nomination.”\n",
      "12. Mason cited her 28 years of experience at the VA, including as chair of the Board of Veterans Appeals during Trump’s first term, and said her work as a senior advisor to Collins would align with her work as an IG.\n",
      "13. “The senior advisor role was to convey, gather information much like a fact finder does and convey that information to the secretary and to other senior leaders,” she said. “So it's very — it correlates well to the inspector general. The difference is the inspector general has teeth and that is very much what is needed in the department.”\n",
      "14. Mason also flummoxed Blumenthal when she said that she wasn’t involved in any decisions or actions at the VA since Trump’s inauguration.\n",
      "15. “As a senior advisor, I’m not involved in any decisions,” she said, later adding “My role was to gather information and convey that information back.”\n",
      "16. “I can't believe that you are telling us that you haven't been involved in a single action or decision as an advisor,” Blumenthal replied.\n",
      "17. Democrats also questioned Mason’s assertion that she does not have a “close” relationship with Collins.\n",
      "18. Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, who caucuses with the Democrats, recalled that Mason, while visiting his office, remarked after seeing a Coke machine that “the secretary is a Coke guy.” Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who previously served as an assistant secretary in the VA, seized on the fact that Mason’s office was in the secretary’s suite.\n",
      "19. “I know exactly what the inner sanctum of the secretary's office looks like and if you're behind those doors, you're in the inner sanctum, you're not just floating out there,” Duckworth said. “So you probably saw him a lot more than you are trying to lead us to believe.”\n",
      "20. Mason said that she would prioritize implementing more than 500 open recommendations from the VA IG. She denied being involved in the mass firings of VA employees , plans to downsize the department workforce by around 80,000 employees or requiring workers to sign non-disclosure agreements .\n",
      "21. She was, however, behind a policy that prohibited Veterans Benefits Administration employees from contacting the VA Office of General Counsel without her approval.\n",

      "1. A Rhode Island federal judge seemed likely Wednesday to block the Transportation Department’s move to yank billions in congressional funding for bridges, roads and airport projects if Democrat-led states do not partake in federal immigration enforcement.\n",
      "2. U.S. District Judge John James McConnell Jr. during a hearing pressed acting U.S. Attorney Sara Miron Bloom on how the Transportation Department could have power over funding that was approved by Congress, saying federal agencies “only have appropriations power given by Congress.”\n",
      "3. “That's how the Constitution works,” he said. “Where does the secretary get the power and authority to impose immigration conditions on transportation funding?”\n",
      "4. The suit brought by 20 Democratic state attorneys general challenges an April directive from Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, a former House member from Wisconsin, that requires states to cooperate in federal immigration enforcement in order to receive federal grants already approved by Congress.\n",
      "5. “Defendents seek to hold hostage tens of billions of dollars of critical transportation funding in order to force the plaintiff states to become mere arms of the federal government's immigration enforcement policies,” Delbert Tran of the California Department of Justice, who argued on behalf of the states, said.\n",
      "6. Arguing on behalf of the Trump administration, Bloom said that Duffy’s letter simply directs the states to follow federal immigration law.\n",
      "7. McConnell, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2011, said that while the states could interpret it that way, the Trump administration has gone after so-called sanctuary cities and targeted them for not taking the same aggressive immigration enforcement as the administration.\n",
      "8. The judge said Bloom’s argument expressed a “very different” interpretation of the directive than how the administration has described it publicly. He also noted President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have “railed on … the issues that arise from sanctuary cities.”\n",
      "9. Trump this week directed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to target Chicago, Los Angeles and New York — three major Democrat-led cities that have policies to not aid in immigration enforcement.\n",
      "10. McConnell said he would make a decision whether to issue a preliminary injunction before Friday. The preliminary injunction would be tailored to the states that brought the suit and would not have a nationwide effect.\n",
      "11. The states that brought the suit are California, Illinois, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Maryland, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.\n",
      "12. Tran said the Department of Transportation’s directive is not only arbitrary and capricious, but undermines congressional authority because Congress appropriated more than $100 billion for transportation projects to the states.\n",
      "13. Cutting off funding would have disastrous consequences, the states have argued.\n",
      "14. “More cars, planes, and trains will crash, and more people will die as a result, if Defendants cut off federal funding to Plaintiff States,” according to the brief from the states.\n",
      "15. Bloom defended Duffy’s letter, saying it listed actions that would impede federal law enforcement and justified withholding of funds because “such actions compromise the safety and security of the transportation systems supported by DOT financial assistance.”\n",
      "16. McConnell said that didn’t answer his question about the secretary’s authority to withhold congressionally appropriated funding.\n",
      "17. “It seems to me that the secretary is saying that a failure to comply with immigration conditions is relevant to the safety and security of the transportation system,” Bloom said.\n",
      "18. McConnell seemed skeptical of that argument.\n",
      "19. “Under that rationale, does the secretary of the Department of Transportation have the authority to impose a condition on federal highway funds that prohibit a state that has legalized abortion from seeking a federal grant?” he asked.\n",
      "20. Bloom said that question was beyond her directive from the Department of Transportation to address in her arguments to the court.\n",
      "21. “I understand your question,” she said. “All I think I can say is that here the secretary has, in his statement, set out a rationale for why this is relevant to DOT funding.”\n",
      "22. Tran said that the “crux of this case is” that the Trump administration is trying “to enforce other laws that do not apply to these grants,” by requiring states to partake in immigration enforcement.\n",
      "23. “It's beyond their statutory authority,” he argued.\n",

      "1. The Trump administration recently began posting signs on federal parks and historic sites asking for help from visitors in identifying language that negatively discussed America’s past or present and launched a process for federal agencies to remove, cover or replace flagged materials.\n",
      "2. In the responses submitted by visitors to National Park Service sites, however, which were obtained by Government Executive , no single submission pointed to any such examples. Instead, in the nearly 200 submissions NPS received in the first days since the solicitations were posted, visitors implored the administration not to erase U.S. history and praised agency staff for improving their experiences.\n",
      "3. The new request at NPS and other Interior Department sites followed an executive order from President Trump dubbed “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History” that called for federal lands to remove information that could “improperly minimize or disparage certain historical figures or events.” That in turn led to an order from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum that department staff solicit public feedback to flag “any signs or other information that are negative about either past or living Americans or that fail to emphasize the beauty, grandeur, and abundance of landscapes and other natural features.” The reviews should include exhibits, brochures, films, waysides and signs, the secretary said.\n",
      "4. In instructions to staff also obtained by Government Executive , NPS employees were told to review feedback from visitors weekly but not yet remove any materials. For each comment, staff can either mark it as received but not requiring action, requiring action but not related to the signage issue or flagged for review by NPS leadership in Washington. Parks will receive follow up information in August.\n",
      "5. In the meantime, NPS said, the agency’s Harpers Ferry Center is currently “developing standard protocols and templates to assist with expedited removal, covering, or temporary replacement of any media that does not comply with” Burgum's order. It added a “long-term plan for permanent replacement is also under development for affected media.”\n",
      "6. So far, NPS is not getting the help it was hoping for from those scanning the QR codes now posted around park sites soliciting assistance in identifying language in violation of Trump and Burgum’s orders. Instead, visitors accused the Trump administration of seeking to erase the nation’s history.\n",
      "7. “There shouldn't be signs about history that whitewash and erase the centuries of discrimination against the people who have cared for this land for generations,” a visitor to Indian Dunes National Park said.\n",
      "8. A visitor to Independence Hall in Philadelphia called the new signs “censorship dressed up as customer service.”\n",
      "9. “What upset me the most about the museum—more than anything in the actual exhibits—were the signs telling people to report anything they thought was negative about Americans,” the visitor said. “That isn't just frustrating, it's outrageous. It felt like an open invitation to police and attack historians for simply doing their jobs: telling the truth.”\n",
      "10. Several visitors to the Stonewall National Monument in New York lamented changes there the park’s website that removed mention of transgender individuals in the Stonewall Uprising.\n",
      "11. “Put them back,” the visitor said. “Honor them. There would be no Stonewall without trans people.”\n",
      "12. A visitor at Yellowstone National Park said the information presented there should challenge people.\n",
      "13. “The executive order to asking for feedback is ****,” the message read. “Parks already do an amazing job telling stories that contain hard truths and everyone is entitled to the truth to make better decisions in our lives. So what if people feel bad?”\n",
      "14. Without factual information, the person added, “everything is just a pretty facade with no real substance.”\n",
      "15. At Manzanar National Historical Site, one of the internment camps that held Japanese immigrants and Japanese-Americans during World War II, a visitor said the site existed to present information about the costly errors in U.S. history.\n",
      "16. “The entire purpose of parks like this one is to learn from the mistakes of the past so we can avoid repeating them,” the visitor said. “Please do not water down the reality of the experience for future visitors.”\n",
      "17. A visitor at the Natchez National Historical Park had a similar takeaway.\n",
      "18. “Slavery was a dark time in our history and we need to come to terms with that,” the individual said, “not gloss it over and romanticize the Antebellum South.”\n",
      "19. Only one visitor—at Petersburg National Battlefield, a Civil War site—noted they read signs that “didn’t sit right,” though the individual did not specify any materials that needed changing. Instead, the person requested a “second look” to potentially identify “more balance.” A Grand Canyon National Park visitor said the site should change its signs, but added “signed, Elon,” suggesting the comment was left in jest.\n",
      "20. Many of the comments asked NPS to include more information that highlighted the U.S. government’s discriminatory practices toward Native Americans. A bevy of visitors also asked for increased staffing and complimented the steps existing employees took to improve their experiences.\n",
      "21. Theresa Pierno, president of the National Parks Conservation Association, called the directive requiring park staff to post the new signs with accompanying QR codes “an outrage” that shows the “deep contempt for their work to preserve and tell American stories.”\n",
      "22. “If our country erases the darker chapters of our history, we will never learn from our mistakes,” Pierno said. “These signs must come down immediately.”\n",
      "23. An Interior Department spokesperson said in response to a request for comment that leaks “will not be tolerated.”\n",
      "24. “It is a true shame that employees are spending their time leaking to the media instead of doing work for the American people, the spokesperson said. “The same American people who fund their paychecks.”\n",
      "25. Trump, in his executive order, said federal lands should display materials that amplify American greatness.\n",
      "26. Park materials should “focus on the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people or, with respect to natural features, the beauty, abundance, and grandeur of the American landscape,” Trump said.\n",
      "27. The Independence Hall visitor suggested that line of thinking would not effect the desired result.\n",
      "28. “Putting up signs like that doesn't protect anyone, [it] just tells visitors that the truth is a problem,” the visitor said. “And I can't think of anything more offensive than that.”\n",

      "1. When a U.S. Senate panel holds a confirmation hearing on Wednesday for Andrea Lucas to lead the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the agency’s former leaders say they will be paying close attention to what she says about EEOC guidance related to pregnancy discrimination and gender identity harassment.\n",
      "2. Lucas has served on the commission since 2020, when President Donald Trump nominated her during his first term. In January, he named her acting chair after firing two of three Democrats serving on the five-member commission before their terms ended — a first by a president in the agency’s 60-year history .\n",
      "3. With only two of five commissioners remaining, the EEOC has not had the necessary quorum to implement meaningful policy directives during Lucas’ interim tenure. Even still, agency observers said, Lucas, who is expected to be confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate, has repeatedly indicated that she plans to make it more difficult for pregnant and gender-diverse people to bring civil rights claims related to their employment.\n",
      "4. EEOC cases involving trans plaintiffs are already at a standstill, whether their harassment claims are related to their gender identities or not, those familiar with the agency’s caseload told The 19th. Lucas wants to revisit regulations related to enforcement of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act that were finalized one year ago today . She has also played a prominent role in the president’s efforts to quash diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, or DEI, in workplaces, sending an unprecedented letter to law firms that countered agency procedure. In a public statement released in late May, Lucas said part of the EEOC’s commitment to enforcing Trump’s DEI orders means backing away from cases related to “neutral employment policy or practice” that has “an unequal outcome on employees of a particular race of sex.”\n",
      "5. Maya Raghu, a senior adviser to a Democratic EEOC commissioner during the Biden administration, called these cases, known as disparate impact-claims, a “powerful tool that helps uncover and remedy discrimination that isn't explicit and ensures that everyone has a fair chance to succeed.”\n",
      "6. Disparate impact cases are often associated with remedying structural racial discrimination but can also be related to sex, gender and disability. The EEOC only had one open disparate impact case, brought in 2024 , challenging hiring policies at Sheetz. The gas station chain screened applicants for criminal convictions, and the agency brought a case due to the disparate impact it had on Black and Indigenous applicants. The EEOC earlier this month moved to dismiss the case , citing Trump’s DEI orders. A worker plaintiff has sought private legal counsel to continue the case.\n",
      "7. “Eliminating disparate impact cases, or de-prioritizing them, as this administration is saying, would really take us back to a time when employers could impose policies that unfairly deny opportunities to people of color, women, older Americans and other historically excluded groups without really having to provide a business necessity for the policies,” said Raghu, who is now at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law directing a project on advancing diversity, equity and inclusion.\n",
      "8. Lucas has also signaled her disapproval of long awaited anti-harassment guidance that the EEOC approved in April 2024 , following the Supreme Court’s 2020 decision in Bostock v. Clayton County. It clarified how the agency would enforce workplace harassment related to “race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetic information.” Lucas voted against it and issued a dissent focused on gender identity, writing that “women’s sex-based rights in the workplace are under attack — and from the EEOC, the very federal agency charged with protecting women from sexual harassment and sex-based discrimination at work.”\n",
      "9. Lucas argued that the position taken by the EEOC in the guidance that denying workers access to bathrooms that matched their gender identities or the intentional use of the wrong pronouns could constitute harassment “impinges on women’s (and indeed, all employees’) rights to freedom of speech and belief.” “Biological sex is real, and it matters. Sex is binary (male and female) and is immutable,” she wrote in the dissent.\n",
      "10. If Lucas is confirmed, and once a quorum is established, the agency is expected to revisit the harassment guidance. She has already drafted and released changes she would like to see, removing mentions of gender identity. Further, the agency went through its open cases and paused many brought by trans plaintiffs, even when their claims involved harassment unrelated to their gender identity, like disability or race, according to multiple people familiar with the agency’s work.\n",
      "11. A federal judge in Texas last month vacated sections of the harassment guidance related to gender identity but the Supreme Court’s 2020 decision in Bostock remains law and the decision is limited in its application.\n",
      "12. Former EEOC Commissioner Chai Feldblum, who served from 2010 to 2019, said there are “two problems going on at the EEOC right now” related to gender identity.\n",
      "13. “One is if you have a gender-identity claim, our understanding is that they're not necessarily immediately dismissing those — although I'm sure they're doing that with a number of them — but they're just putting it in black holes and not doing anything,” Feldblum explained. “But it’s also being over applied in offices around the country so that even if a transgender person comes in with a disability claim, or they come in with a sexual harassment charge not related to their gender identity, their charge is not being done.”\n",
      "14. “Transgender people are being adversely affected, both with regard to gender identity claims and with regard to unrelated claims,” said Feldblum, who earlier this year co-founded the EEO Leadership Group . Feldblum said she initially got the group of former EEOC leaders together to see if they could help represent transgender plaintiffs whose cases were languishing. Ahead of Lucas’ hearing this week, they released a letter responding to her revised harassment guidance.\n",
      "15. EEO Leadership Group members said another aspect of the agency’s work that they expect to come up during Lucas’ hearing that would disproportionately affect women is her desire to revisit the guidance related to pregnant workers issued last year.\n",
      "16. Lucas also voted against that final rule and released a 16-page dissent . She wrote that while she supported “elements,” she believed the rule established “new accommodation requirements to reach virtually every condition, circumstance, or procedure that relates to any aspect of the female reproductive system.”\n",
      "17. While Lucas’ desire to revisit the pregnancy guidance is rooted in her opposition to abortion and related workforce accommodations, “once they reopen it, they can make any changes that a majority agrees on,” noted Karla Gilbride, who was general counsel at the EEOC until February, when she joined the public interest law firm Public Citizen. Gilbride is also a member of the EEO Leadership Group.\n",
      "18. Jenny Yang, another former EEOC commissioner and member of the leadership group who now is a partner at the law from Outten & Golden, said that Lucas’ public positions, when combined with her focus on Trump’s DEI efforts and her letter to law firms, indicate that under her leadership, the EEOC would operate very differently than it has in the past.\n",
      "19. “Unfortunately, it does appear that Lucas’ priorities are a real retreat from the historic mission of the agency,” Yang said. “I think that she is demonstrating that she's a full participant in this administration's effort to intimidate employers from engaging in fully lawful efforts to prevent discrimination.”\n",

      "3. That means federal employees that also serve as military reservists may have new claims on differential pay based on their past active duty service, and the Merit Systems Protection Board, which handles the claims, may soon have more work.\n",
      "4. “Differential pay is codified and provided for for federal employees that are impacted and called to active duty,” said Michael Macomber, partner and CEO at Tully Rinckey PLLC, a national law firm with an extensive government services practice. “What ultimately the Supreme Court found here, it is making it easier for reservists who are impacted who want to file claims to prove that they were, in fact, impacted.”\n",
      "5. The decision stems from a lawsuit filed by Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controller Nick Feliciano, who also served as a Coast Guard reserve petty officer. Feliciano was called up in July 2012 and remained on active duty until February 2017, “serving aboard a Coast Guard ship escorting vessels to and from harbor” that had supported Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, noting that his orders in support of several contingency operations.\n",
      "6. The MSPB rejected Feliciano’s claims for differential pay during his service and he appealed to the Federal Circuit, which also ruled against him, citing “he must show not only that he served while a national emergency was ongoing, but also that a substantive connection linked his service to a particular national emergency.”\n",
      "7. But the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that Feliciano did not need to establish that his service was substantially connected to a national emergency because it was supporting contingency operations.\n",
      "8. Macomber said since the decision, Tully Rinckey has received “dozens if not hundreds of inquiries from federal employees about their eligibility for such claims, given that the law firm has worked with feds in the past to obtain the documentation needed to assert such claims.\n",
      "9. Those claims will be first filed with the MSPB, which is currently without a quorum after President Trump fired board member Cathy Harris i n February , the Supreme Court temporarily upheld the firing in May, pending a full ruling the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\n",
      "10. A spokesperson for the MSPB said corrective action on differential pay claims would only be delayed “if the initial decision is appealed by either party” and that regional and field offices remain fully functional to handle such claims. The spokesperson added that MSPB has not yet seen a noticeable uptick in the claims following the Feliciano decision.\n",
      "11. Macomber said that the decision highlights new resources that federal employees may not even be aware that they have access to.\n",
      "12. “I think the real benefit at this point in time is making sure that employees are aware of these benefits and that they should be applying for these benefits,” he said. “What I see is a lot of people not applying for them and not taking advantage benefits available to them.”\n",
