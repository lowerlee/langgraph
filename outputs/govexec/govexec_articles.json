    "title": "Court filing reveals which offices at 17 agencies the Trump administration had slated for layoffs",
    "author": "Eric Katz",
    "content": "The Trump administration revealed to a federal court on Thursday the specific offices at which widespread layoffs were planned as of earlier this year, providing rare insight into the scale of its proposed reductions in force.Some of the list details RIFs that have already been announced, such as those at the Health and Human Services Department or the General Services Administration. Most, however, have not been previously reported and offer new details on the administration’s plans. The filing contains requests for approval sent to the Office of Personnel Management in March and April. Administration officials have made clear some of those plans are no longer operative, particularly as agencies have successfully shed staff through various incentive programs.Agencies made the requests to OPM to allow for hastened layoffs after adjusting their “competitive areas, ” the groupings of employees agencies must create before engaging in RIFs. In most cases, OPM signed off on the requests within one or two days.The Agriculture Department sought approval for layoffs at a slew of offices, but revealed on Thursday it will restructure itself through mandatory and voluntary relocations and only deploy RIFs if necessary. HHS and the State Department have moved forward with their RIFs, and their requests to OPM show only a portion of the layoffs they ultimately implemented.The administration revealed the requests to the U.S. Court for the Northern District of California after Judge Susan Illston ordered their disclosure. Illston previously blocked the administration from moving forward with RIFs at all, but that injunction was overturned by the Supreme Court. The judge is now seeking to verify the legality of RIF plans on an agency-by-agency basis and sought information from 17 agencies the administration had told the Supreme Court were set to begin layoffs when Illston’s injunction took effect.The Trump administration said the list in some cases undercounted the number of offices developing RIF plans and in others overcounted and has consistently maintained its plans were moving targets. An appeals court this week blocked another orde r from Illston requiring the administration to disclose to the court reorganization and RIF plans at every major agency, though those were not yet set to be made public.Here is a list of which agencies and offices were planning widespread layoffs earlier this year:Federal Mediation and Conciliation ServiceGeneral Services AdministrationHealth and Human Services DepartmentHousing and Urban Development DepartmentInstitute of Museum and Library ServicesNational Archives and Records AdministrationNational Endowment for HumanitiesU.S. African Development FoundationWoodrow Wilson International Center for ScholarsSean Michael Newhouse contributed to this report.",

    "title": "Why federal retirements are spiking this year",
    "author": "Tammy Flanagan",
    "content": "The Office of Personnel Management received 70, 351 retirement applications by the end of June—nearly a 40% increase over the same period in 2024, when 50, 305 applications were filed.The uptick is not unexpected. Federal workforce reductions have been underway since the “Fork in the Road” memo was issued in late January. That program, now closed, introduced a Deferred Resignation option that allowed employees to stay on the payroll without performing duties, with the expectation they’d resign or retire by Sept. 30, 2025.But many employees didn’t wait.A spike in May and June retirements appears to be driven by concerns over changes to retirement benefits that were initially outlined in the “Big Beautiful Bill, ” signed into law July 4.In the end, none of the proposed cuts to federal retirement benefits made it into the final version of the bill.The high-three salary calculation remains in place. FERS employees who retire before age 62 with an immediate, unreduced annuity will continue to receive the Special Retirement Supplement, bridging the gap to Social Security eligibility at age 62.Still, many employees rushed into retirement without fully preparing for the long-term financial impact. If you’re one of them—or are considering retirement—here are some critical questions to ask yourself:Are your savings enough to supplement your FERS and Social Security benefits?If married, do you understand the cost and value of the survivor benefit election?Do you know your options for continuing FEGLI coverage?Have you accounted for potential long-term care costs?Did you save enough in the Thrift Savings Plan?Let’s say you earned $105, 000 annually, with take-home pay of $73, 500 after withholdings.If you retire under FERS with 30 years of service, your benefit would be about 30% of your high-three salary, or $30, 000. Add the Special Retirement Supplement—roughly $15, 000—and your gross benefit would be $45, 000 annually.If you elect the full survivor benefit, your FERS annuity would be reduced by 10%, lowering your total to $42, 000.After taxes and insurance, that could drop to around $32, 000—$41, 500 less than your pre-retirement net income, or about $3, 400 less per month.Even with a $1 million TSP balance, you’d need to plan carefully to close that gap—especially after taxes.How much will you need to withdraw from your TSP each year?Will you need to cut spending to make ends meet?Do you need to match your net income in retirement—or just get close?Will your benefits keep up with inflation?A lack of \"longevity literacy\" is hurting retirement planning, according to a 2023 survey by the TIAA Institute and the Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center at George Washington University.Fewer than 40% of adults correctly estimated average lifespan at age 65. One in four people who are 65 today will live past 90. One in 10 will live beyond 95, according to the Social Security Administration.Only 12% of respondents demonstrated strong longevity literacy by correctly answering related questions.Spending may actually increase in early retirement, as retirees pursue long-postponed travel, hobbies, or family goals like helping kids with weddings or college.How much income your spouse will need if you pass away first?Whether life insurance can replace the survivor benefit?How long you and your spouse might live—and how inflation could affect your finances?Basic FEGLI coverage continues at no premium after age 65, though it gradually reduces. Optional coverage is available but comes with rising premiums. You’ll elect FEGLI continuation using form SF 2818.Long-term care is one of the biggest threats to retirement security.Medicare doesn’t cover it, and Medicaid eligibility requires meeting strict income and asset thresholds—often as low as $2, 000 in assets for individuals.According to Morningstar, baby boomers can expect to spend an average of $250, 000 on long-term care in retirement.Many people assume they’ll inherit enough to cover gaps in retirement funding. But medical bills, divorce or longevity may drain your parents’ assets.A better plan is to save independently—then any inheritance is a bonus, not a necessity.“I have time to save later.” You lose out on compound interest by waiting. Start now, even with a small amount.“I won’t live that long.” Average lifespans have risen, and 25% of people 65 today will live past 90.“My kids’ college comes first.” There are loans for school, but not for retirement. Make both priorities if you can.“I’ll work in retirement.” Many who plan to work can’t, due to age discrimination or health issues.“I’ll need less money in retirement.” That might not be true, especially in the early years when you’re more active.You can’t change the past, but you can start making better financial decisions today.Don’t let misconceptions—or wishful thinking—undermine your future. A thoughtful retirement plan can help ensure your post-federal life is secure, fulfilling, and free from financial regret.OPM’s digital retirement application is live.

    "title": "Trump’s controversial OSC nominee pulled from confirmation hearing",
    "author": "Erich Wagner",
    "content": "A Senate panel that was set to consider President Donald Trump’s nominee to serve as U.S. Special Counsel announced Thursday that Paul Ingrassia’s appearance before the committee had been postponed, after the 28-year-old’s lack of legal experience, association with neo-Nazis and an extensive public record of denigrating federal workers produced widespread outcry.The announcement came at the outset of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee’s confirmation hearing, originally slated for six nominees to administration and judicial posts. The panel also postponed consideration of Charles Arrington, who Trump quietly tapped in May to replace ousted Federal Labor Relations Authority Chairwoman Susan Tsui Grundmann.Grundmann has contested her firing, though a federal appeals court earlier this month allowed her removal to take effect while her case proceeds.“I’m relieved to see that Paul Ingrassia, the nominee to run the Office of Special Counsel, has been pulled from today’s hearing, ” said Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., the committee’s top Democrat. “The Office of Special Counsel is an independent, nonpartisan agency that investigates allegations of prohibited personnel practices involving federal employees, including whistleblower retaliation. Mr. Ingrassia is unqualified for the position both in terms of his legal experience, and given his long history of bigoted statements, and I urge the administration to formally withdraw his nomination.”Ingrassia’s nomination had drawn the ire of a wide range of stakeholders, including federal employee unions, professional associations that represent federal managers and good government organizations. Nearly two dozen of those groups jointly urged all 100 senators to oppose the “demonstrably unserious nominee” earlier this week.Ingrassia has publicly associated with white supremacist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes, as well as Andrew Tate, the conservative social media influencer who is wanted in multiple countries on rape and sex trafficking charges.And he has written extensively of his disdain for federal workers, describing them as “parasites” and “bugmen” who “leech of the diminishing lifeblood of the dying republic.”In a statement, American Federation of Government Employees National President Everett Kelley applauded the postponement of Ingrassia’s hearing.“Our members deserve an OSC led by someone who respects and understands the critical role federal employees play in serving and protecting the American public, ” Kelley said. “Federal employees who blow the whistle on waste, fraud and abuse put their careers on the line to expose corruption. They deserve protection, not persecution. The Senate must reject Ingrassia and demand a nominee committed to fairness, accountability and respect for public servants.”",

    "title": "Whistleblower bill for contractors gains bipartisan support with Grassley’s backing",
    "author": "Sean Michael Newhouse",
    "content": "Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has signed on as a cosponsor of a bill to expand whistleblower protections for government contractors, giving the legislation bipartisan support.“Whistleblowers working for federal contractors and subcontractors shouldn’t face retaliation for sounding the alarm on waste, fraud and abuse. These patriots are critical in safeguarding Americans’ tax dollars, ” Grassley said in a statement on Tuesday . “As a long-time advocate for whistleblowers, I’m glad to sponsor this legislation to strengthen protections for whistleblowers and close the loopholes that have allowed retaliation.”The Expanding Whistleblower Protections for Contractors Act of 2025 ( S. 874 ) would extend protections to contractors who refuse to follow orders that would violate the law, remove an exception that allows executive branch officials to order a reprisal against a whistleblower under certain circumstances and invalidate any predispute arbitration agreement that waives a contractor’s whistleblower rights, among other provisions.The bill is sponsored by Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., the ranking member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. That panel advanced a similar version of the bill last year in an 11-0 vote.\"Whistleblowers who expose government fraud deserve strong protection from retaliation, \" Peters said in a statement. \"This bipartisan legislation closes dangerous loopholes in current law and ensures that contractor employees can report wrongdoing without fear of reprisal. By strengthening these safeguards, we're protecting both whistleblowers and taxpayer dollars.\"The whistleblower-focused Make It Safe Coalition, which includes nonprofits like the Government Accountability Project and Project on Government Oversight, has endorsed the bill.“All accountability laws need periodic maintenance to plug loopholes, bolster weak links and act on lessons learned. While America’s government contractor whistleblower law was an effective accountability breakthrough for the 2008 stimulus, it has not been updated for almost a decade, ” they wrote in a July 18 letter . “The result is that the taxpayers increasingly have been getting fleeced. In the face of unprecedented government spending, the accountability vacuum must be filled.”Grassley, who co-chairs the Senate Whistleblower Protection Caucus, introduced the bipartisan AI Whistleblower Protection Act ( S. 1792 ) in May. That bill would prohibit companies from retaliating against employees who blow the whistle on an AI security vulnerability or violation of federal law. Rep. Jay Obernolte, R-Calif., sponsored companion legislation ( H.R. 3460 ).",

    "title": "USDA to relocate thousands of staff outside Washington, consolidate dozens of offices",
    "author": "Eric Katz",
    "content": "The Agriculture Department will soon move thousands of employees out of the Washington area and consolidate dozens of offices, likely leading to significant further reductions to USDA’s already shrinking workforce.The department will utilize layoffs “if needed, ” USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a memorandum accompanying the announcement, without specifying what circumstances would lead to their deployment. It will use mandatory reassignments, however, which can result in terminations if employees refuse them. USDA currently has 4, 600 employees in the Washington area and is looking to shrink that number to 2, 000. Just 10% of the department’s workforce is currently in the capital region.Rollins said USDA was not conducting a “large-scale workforce reduction, ” but ensuring it can “afford its workforce” and this was part of a process of shrinking it.The department is standing up five regional hubs around the country that will house relocated employees, located in Raleigh, North Carolina; Kansas City, Missouri; Indianapolis; Fort Collins, Colorado; and Salt Lake City, Utah. Rollins boasted those areas have smaller locality pay adjustments than Washington. USDA will also maintain offices in Albuquerque and Minneapolis, but is slashing regional offices across the country and consolidating many support functions.Government Executive in April first reported on the relocations out of Washington, standing up of new hubs and reductions to regional staff. Existing regional employees will be re-located to hub location “to the greatest extent possible.”USDA did not specify what will happen to employees in consolidated or eliminated offices, noting only that the process would play out over the coming months and employees would learn more about relocations in the next month. It has already shed more than 15, 000 employees from its initiative that allowed employees to sit on paid leave for several months before resigning.A spokesperson for the department declined to spell out any additional details on the timing of the changes or the fate of employees in consolidated offices, saying only that Thursday’s announcement was a “first step.”“Some aspects of the reorganization will be implemented over the coming months while other aspects will take more time to implement, ” the spokesperson said. “We will be transparent on the progress and continue to provide updates to employees as we have them.”As Government Executive previously reported, USDA is vacating the South Building—one of its two main headquarters buildings in Washington—as well as its Braddock Place facility in Alexandria, Virginia. It will eventually get rid of the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center and the George Washington Carver Center in Maryland.Among the changes USDA will implement to its component agencies are:Employees focusing on communications, finance, budget, human resources, lease administration and grants will all be consolidated into a more streamlined structure, the department said. Among the entities that will be consolidated into others are the department’s civil rights office, the Freedom of Information Act office and Legislative Affairs functions.Rollins said in a video message to employees that they were all an important part of the USDA family, while acknowledging many of them will soon have to make difficult decisions.“We recognize each employee has unique circumstances to consider, and any decisions you pursue are personal and yours alone, but we stand ready to serve you, to help you through this process, ” Rollins said, adding the changes would put employees closer to those the department serves while reducing their cost of living.One NRCS employee said some workers in the office Thursday were crying after the reorganization news came out, likening the new reality of potential reductions in force hinging on relocation acceptance and terminations to the Hunger Games. The deferred resignation program, the employee said, has already “turned the agency into Swiss cheese with vacancies from the local offices to the highest levels.”“We have not filled any of them and this reorganization will create more holes in that block of cheese, ” the employee said. “The public, employees, agencies and environment will suffer.”NRCS last week asked employees to voluntarily transfer into mission-critical positions it just incentivized employees to leave.An employee in a USDA budgeting office estimated the department will spend about $150, 000 for each employee it relocates. Rollins suggested more separation incentives would be forthcoming, perhaps giving the department an offramp to push out employees who do not want to relocate without firing them.Such an outcome would save the department money in relocation costs and avoiding the severance payments that typically accompany layoffs. The budgeting employee suggested USDA knows most employees will not accept the relocations and the goal is to shed staff.“At the end of the day, they’re firing people, ” the employee said.In 2019, the department relocated the Agriculture Department’s Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture to Kansas City, over the objections of employees and some lawmakers. Following the move, both agencies lost more than half of their staff, leading to a significant loss of productivity from which it took the agencies years to recover . Under President Biden, both agencies moved their headquarters back to Washington while maintaining their Kansas City offices.Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents many USDA employees, said the moves were an attempt to \"eliminate USDA workers and minimize their critical work.\"\"D.C. is the center of our nation’s government for a reason, as it facilitates needed coordination between senior leadership and field offices and ensures agencies are at the seat of the table when decisions are made at the White House and in Congress, \" Kelley said. \"This administration is moving at breakneck speed to slash the size of the federal government, often with little thought into the consequences this will have on the American people who rely on the services our members deliver.\"An employee in the Agricultural Research Service, which is folding its area offices into its Office of National Programs, despite the area offices having more staff than ONP, said the farmers and producers USDA serves are not likely to approve of the changes.“I can’t imagine stakeholders are going to be happy, ” the employee said.",

    "title": "Another judge has dismissed the Trump administration’s effort to pre-clear anti-union EO",
    "author": "Erich Wagner",
    "content": "This story has been updated at 2:45 p.m. ET.A federal judge in Texas on Wednesday denied the Trump administration’s effort to attain the judicial greenlight to enforce a March executive order stripping two-thirds of the federal workforce of its collective bargaining rights.The edict invoked a rarely used provision of the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act to strip most federal employees of their collective bargaining rights under the auspices of national security. But before the order was published and announced, the Trump administration sued both the American Federation of Government Employees and National Treasury Employees Union in seemingly GOP-friendly federal district court jurisdictions seeking preemptive declarations that the order is lawful.In May, a federal judge in Kentucky dismissed the case against NTEU, finding that the administration lacked standing, as federal case law has long barred jurists from issuing so-called “advisory opinions” about the legality of a law without an underlying injury. In a 27-page opinion, U.S. District Judge Alan D. Albright, a Trump appointee in Texas’ Western District, followed suit in the case against AFGE.“Plaintiffs ask this court to do something it should not and cannot do: issue a declaratory judgment pre-approving the acts of executive agencies absent a legally cognizable injury-in-fact, ” Albright wrote. “This court is unable to identify a single instance in which a federal court has exercised jurisdiction over agencies seeking a pre-enforcement declaratory judgment approving their desired future course of conduct. Plaintiffs’ suit, however well-intentioned, is an unprecedented invitation for an advisory opinion—one that could open a Pandora’s Box of encouraging the executive branch to seek the judiciary’s blessing for every executive order prior to implementation.”Though both cases were predicated on federal agencies waiting to formally implement the executive order vis-à-vis the cancellation of union contracts, federal agencies have effectively ended unions’ presence at impacted agencies and agency subcomponents since March. Agencies by their own admission have already ceased participating in collective bargaining negotiations as well as grievance and arbitration proceedings, and federal payroll processors surreptitiously halted the automatic collection of dues from federal employees’ biweekly paychecks in April.At the heart of Albright’s decision, however, is the fact that the Trump administration filed its lawsuit against AFGE prior to the union’s knowledge of the underlying policy, making it impossible for there to have been a controversy between the parties on this issue. That federal employee unions ultimately filed their own lawsuits to block the order is irrelevant.“Was there a possibility that a lawsuit seeking to enjoin the executive order would be filed, given the numerous challenges brought against other executive orders? Yes, ” Albright wrote. “But Article III standing is not satisfied by mere possibilities or anticipated legal challenges. Here, the parties did not have an ongoing dispute over the executive order when this lawsuit was filed. In hindsight, we know that defendants oppose the executive order and seek a judgment that it is unconstitutional. But plaintiffs have not plausibly shown such a dispute existed when they filed this lawsuit.”In their own lawsuits, NTEU, AFGE and other unions secured two preliminary injunctions blocking the order’s implementation, though both decisions have been stayed by appellate courts pending further review.AFGE National President Everett Kelley said his union will continue to fight the initiative, which he and other union leaders have argued is a violation of federal workers’ First Amendment rights.“We are very pleased that the courts have once again ultimately sided with public servants and AFGE and stopped another attack by this administration on the patriotic, dedicated Americans who serve their country in the federal government, ” he said. “AFGE will never stop fighting to uphold our rights, our contracts, the rule of law, and the integrity of the people’s government.”",

    "title": "Lawmakers pursue parallel paths toward blocking Trump’s anti-union order",
    "author": "Erich Wagner",
    "content": "As federal employee unions continue to fight the Trump administration’s effort to strip two-thirds of the federal workforce of their collective bargaining rights in federal courts, a bipartisan group of lawmakers are working on multiple fronts to pass legislation overriding the president’s executive order.Trump in March signed an executive order citing a little-used provision of the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act to bar unions from a host of federal agencies and agency subcomponents under the guise of national security. Democrats and union leaders argue that the citation of national security is mere pretext for retaliating against labor groups that have filed lawsuits challenging the administration’s workforce policies.Though the debate over Trump’s edict has been relatively quiet in Congress since the April introduction of the Protect America’s Workforce Act ( H.R. 2550 ), which would nullify Trump’s executive order and bar federal funds from being used to implement it, two separate developments last week suggest there may be more an for overriding the president even in the Republican-controlled House.First, Democrats announced last week that with the legislation, introduced by Reps. Jared Golden, D-Maine, and Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., boasting 222 cosponsors, they have begun circulating a discharge petition that would force its consideration on the House floor. At a press conference last week, Golden said unions within the government’s national security agencies improve mission delivery, contrary to Trump’s assertions.“If it comes to the House floor, we can win, ” he said. “We’ve got 222 cosponsors, including seven Republicans, which is more than enough to pass the bill, but there has been no willingness to bring it to the floor from the Republican leadership. All of those who cosponsored our bill did so because they believe these workers’ rights are worth protecting and that when workers bargain collectively, it produces a fair workplace where employees have dignity and respect.”“Congress granted collective bargaining rights for federal employees decades ago, and they’ve been upheld for years by administrations of both parties—Republican and Democrat, ” said Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich. “Now, thousands have had those rights taken away. I want to be very clear: this action is clear retaliation and union busting, plain and simple. And it’s a threat to organized labor and workers everywhere.”And over in the House Armed Services Committee, that panel narrowly voted to add language to the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act that would bar the executive order’s implementation at the Defense Department. Rep. Donald Norcross, D-N.J., was able to secure the votes of Reps. Don Bacon, R-Neb., Mike Turner, R-Ohio, and Derrick Van Orden, R-Wisc., to successfully amend the annual must-pass bill.“The Trump administration has launched one of the biggest attacks on American labor in history, stripping collective bargaining rights from more than 1 million federal employees, including at DOD, ” Norcross said during a markup last week. “The justification was national security concerns, but the facts tell a very different story . . . This executive order is blatant union busting, and it is clear that this effort is not based on national security but instead on retaliation for unions’ defending their members’ rights, and as a tactic to make it easier to fire employees.”Rep. Jeff Crank, R-Colo., described the amendment as “a serious overreach, ” and suggested that the measure was an effort by Democrats to “score political points” with labor groups.“This EO simply says that when it comes to defense, the president needs the flexibility to act quickly and decisively, not get bogged down in union negotiations, ” Crank said. “[This] amendment needlessly restricts the president’s constitutional authority to manage the executive branch and protect the nation.”Since the executive order—and although agencies have insisted to federal judges that they are waiting for judicial assent before implementing Trump’s edict—agencies have cancelled the automatic collection of union dues from federal employees’ paychecks and ceased participating in collective bargaining negotiations and grievance and arbitration proceedings.",

    "title": "Most Americans oppose RIFs, but a good-government group says anti-layoff messaging needs to be improved",
    "author": "Sean Michael Newhouse",
    "content": "Based on focus groups, surveys and their own experiences, experts at the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan non-profit that conducts research into the public’s perception of government, developed messaging recommendations for those opposed to the Trump administration’s cuts of federal employees that, they believe, will influence more people.“Since we started studying these issues five years ago, it's very clear that most people don't know what the federal government does for them, and that's even more critical now we're talking about things being cut, ” said Lindsay Laferriere, the director of the Partnership’s “Rebuilding Trust in Government” initiative, during a Tuesday webinar .The webinar focused on survey data that the organization released on June 24 that found 51% of U.S. adults oppose the president’s layoffs of federal workers (37% support, 12% don’t know) and half are against funding cuts to agencies (38% support, 12% don’t know). These results largely align with recent polling from the Associated Press and Pew Research Center .There was a partisan split in responses, with Republicans being more likely to support the job cuts than Democrats. While 46% of independents were against the layoffs, 36% reported they didn’t know.The data came from a nationally representative poll of 800 U.S. adults performed between March 31 to April 6. The Partnership also conducted three focus groups in February respectively with Republicans, Democrats and “people who said they were not close followers of government news.”While a narrow majority of Americans are opposed to the governmentwide reductions in force, according to the data, the Partnership said people are more concerned about how the layoffs will affect them rather than federal employees themselves.“We found through our focus groups that there's not a lot of sympathy for civil servants losing their jobs. There's a lot of people who say ‘Well, that happens in the real world. It happens in the business world. So federal employees losing their jobs, that's just what happens, ’” said senior research manager Paul Hitlin. “It’s beneficial to not necessarily focus on that element and to focus really on the impact of what those cuts will be.”Still, Hitlin said there is value in highlighting individual government workers, which the Partnership has done with its long-running annual awards for outstanding federal employees .“What we found is that people, in a good way, often generalize. When they learn about a particular person who's done really great work, it makes them think ‘Oh, there are other people in the government who are doing great work, ’” he said.Interestingly, however, knowing someone who works for the federal government does not seem to affect one’s support or opposition to the layoffs.“Whether or not someone knows a federal employee does not seem to be much of a factor in their views of the administration’s actions, ” according to the survey report. “Of people who know a federal employee, 40% support the cuts while 56% oppose them. Roughly the same amount (41%) of those who do not know a federal employee support the cuts, although a slightly lower percentage of such people are in opposition at 49%.”Additionally, 54% of respondents said they don’t know anyone personally impacted by the federal spending cuts and layoffs compared with 12% who said they were directly affected and 23% who said they know someone personally impacted.The Partnership also reported that backers of the Trump administration’s cuts mostly want to maintain a nonpartisan civil service, with 76% of respondents who supported the reductions agreeing that civil servants should be apolitical.“The people who are supporting these cuts are not supporting it because they want to see a politicized civil service, ” Hitlin said. “That's not why they support it. It really is about cutting spending and waste and fraud.”Trump has sought to bring more political appointees into government and make it easier to fire career civil servants in order to advance his agenda and “dismantle the deep state and reclaim our government from Washington corruption.”GOP pollster says survey data shows Americans would not support Trump’s efforts to reinstitute Schedule FSurvey says…most Americans don’t like DOGE",

    "title": "Russ Vought bills CFPB $5M for his security detail",
    "author": "Eric Katz",
    "content": "The director of the White House’s budget office wears multiple hats, including the temporary head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.The Office of Management and Budget is now billing CFPB $4.7 million for Russ Vought’s security detail, according to a memorandum obtained by Government Executive . The memo, sent by CFPB’s deputy chief financial officer to staff last week, spells out that OMB and CFPB are entering into an interagency agreement to pay the costs.The memo spelled out that the agreement was “on a fast track, ” despite the funding not being included in the bureau’s fiscal 2025 budget. The $4.7 million will cover Vought’s security through December, meaning it will draw from both fiscal years 2025 and 2026. The CFO’s office noted funding will have to be shifted to the director’s front office to cover the costs. Vought is CFPB’s acting director.Rachel Cauley, a spokesperson for OMB and CFPB, blamed the media for creating an alleged rise in threats against members of the Trump administration.“OMB and CFPB will do everything we can to ensure the safety of the director and his family, ” Cauley said.She did not respond to questions regarding why CFPB was footing the bill for Vought’s security or whether the bureau’s share represented the entirety of the director’s security expense.The added expense comes at a difficult time for CFPB’s finances. The bureau is funded as a percentage of the Federal Reserve’s operating expenses and the recently signed into law One Big Beautiful Bill Act lowered the cap for CFPB from 12% of those expenses to 6.5%. CFPB’s budget was $823 million in fiscal 2025.Agencies do not generally disclose what they spend for their director’s security. The Government Accountability Office last reported on it in 1994 and found 10 cabinet-level departments spent a total of around $2 million annually protecting their top officials. More recently, the Environmental Protection Agency’s inspector general found the agency spent $3.5 million on then-Administrator Scott Pruitt’s security in 2017. The IG said that had doubled from the year prior—the last year of the Obama administration—an increase EPA had not justified.President Trump and Vought have pushed to essentially eliminate CFPB, seeking to lay off nearly the entire staff and prevent it from conducting most investigations. Those layoffs have been blocked by a federal court and employees are back at work, though their casework has been significantly diminished.Doreen Greenwald, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, said the agency should focus its limited resources on delivering on its mission of preventing unfair financial practices.“The American people should be outraged that the White House official determined to eliminate the agency that shields them from financial fraud is now diverting agency resources to pay for his security detail, ” Greenwald said.This story has been updated with additional comment.",

    "title": "Agency RIF plans will remain secret for now after court blocks release",
    "author": "Eric Katz",
    "content": "Federal agencies will not have to release its mass layoff plans after an appeals court granted the Trump administration’s request to delay a judge’s prior order, once again setting back efforts to block large-scale workforce reductions from moving forward.A U.S. district court in northern California ruled last week that most major agencies must turn over their reduction-in-force plans to the judge and plaintiffs who sued over the cuts. While those plans were not yet set to be made public, Judge Susan Illston said she wanted to review them in order to litigate whether they were following federal statutes. Agencies were also facing a requirement to publicly lay out around 70 RIF actions that were previously underway before Illston blocked them from moving forward.Ahead of Wednesday’s deadline for the plans to be unveiled privately and the already underway RIF actions to be unveiled publicly, the Trump administration asked the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to block Illston’s order on an emergency basis. The court on Tuesday evening agreed to pause that order from taking effect. The judges—a panel of two President Clinton appointees and one George W. Bush appointee—said only the order was stayed pending further action.The Trump administration has repeatedly argued the RIF plans are deliberative in nature and subject to change and therefore should not be released—privately or publicly. Their release, it said, would have a chilling effect on internal discussions within the executive branch going forward.Illston had rejected that argument, noting the administration previously told the Supreme Court that her order blocking all layoffs at impacted agencies paused dozens of RIF actions—affecting an untold number of employees—from moving forward. If the plans were developed sufficiently such that the order stopped them from taking imminent effect, the judge said, they were not in a “predecisional” phase.The Office of Personnel Management and Office of Management and Budget issued a memorandum in February requiring agencies to submit reorganization and RIF plans. Those plans are now potentially facing public scrutiny.The Supreme Court earlier this month struck down Illston’s larger injunction on the RIFs, allowing agencies to move forward with layoffs. So far, the departments of State, Health and Human Services and Education, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, have announced, implemented or finalized RIFs following the Supreme Court’s decision. Illston said despite the high court's ruling, she is interested in evaluating the legality of individual agency's layoff plans.More agencies are taking steps toward potentially implementing widespread layoffs. The Interior Department notified employees this week it had updated its “competitive areas, ” the groupings of employees agencies must create before engaging in RIFs. Interior was set to lay off thousands of employees imminently when Illston’s original injunction took effect. The Agriculture Department has asked employees to transfer to mission-critical roles while reminding them more staffing cuts are expected.The Trump administration said in a court filing last week 19 agencies had submitted to the Office of Personnel Management requests to change its competitive areas: the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Education, Energy, HHS, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, State, Transportation and Treasury, as well as AmeriCorps, EPA, General Services Administration, Small Business Administration, Social Security Administration, National Science Foundation and OPM itself.OPM said some of those agencies are now walking back portions of their plans, due to voluntary and incentivized departures in their workforces over the last few months.RIF watch: See which agencies are laying off federal workersJudge says she’s not done with RIF case just yetUSDA asks employees to transfer to 'critical' vacancies, suggests more cuts coming",

    "title": "Why a federal program paying employees not to work may violate spending laws",
    "author": "Madeline Materna",
    "content": "Agencies appear to be making unauthorized payments on a large scale. Federal spending law prohibits agencies from using funds without congressional authorization. But under the Fork in the Road deferred resignation program (DRP), tens of thousands of employees are receiving full salaries while barred from working. These expenditures may not only be ill-advised but could violate the law and expose agency officials to personal liability.One of the foundational principles of American constitutional design is that Congress controls the “power of the purse.” The Appropriations Clause vests Congress with authority to determine how public funds are spent. Congress has implemented this authority through statutes such as the Purpose Statute and the Antideficiency Act. Together, these laws prohibit agencies from using appropriated funds for unauthorized purposes or obligating funds beyond what Congress has made legally available. In short, agencies may not spend a dollar without explicit congressional authorization. The DRP appears to violate this requirement in multiple ways.DRP payments may violate the Purpose StatuteThe Purpose Statute requires that appropriated funds be applied “only to the objects for which the appropriations were made.” Courts and the Government Accountability Office have consistently held that this means expenditures must be explicitly or implicitly authorized. Payments under the DRP satisfy neither condition.Most agency appropriations provide for “salaries and expenses” or “necessary expenses.” Salary, under any reasonable interpretation, means payment in exchange for services rendered. DRP participants are placed on administrative leave and are explicitly barred from working. Paying regular wages under these conditions cannot be considered a lawful salary expenditure. It is no more authorized than distributing federal funds to individuals with no connection to the government.These payments also fail under the necessary expense doctrine, which allows implicit spending only when it bears a logical relationship to a legitimate purpose and is not otherwise prohibited by law. DRP payments fail both prongs. According to GAO precedent, expenditures that primarily benefit employees rather than the agency are treated as personal expenses and may not be paid using appropriated funds. Because the sole purpose of DRP payments is to compensate employees for not working, they serve no operational function and cannot be justified as a necessary expense.The payments also violate statutory limits on administrative leave. The Administrative Leave Act of 2016 limits administrative leave to 10 workdays per year. The DRP offers up to eight months of leave—well beyond this cap. Moreover, the program functions similarly to a voluntary separation incentive payment (VSIP), which is governed by its own statutory framework. VSIPs must be offered pursuant to a formal, agency-specific plan approved by the Office of Personnel Management, must be paid as a lump sum, and are capped at $25, 000. The DRP satisfies none of these conditions. It was launched government-wide without agency-specific plans and initially not by the employing agencies themselves but by OPM acting unilaterally. It pays ongoing salary instead of a lump sum and likely exceeds the statutory ceiling for many participants.To illustrate the scale: any employee earning more than $37, 500 annually who accepted the DRP offer in January and remained on leave through September would exceed the $25, 000 ceiling. This includes all General Schedule employees at grade 6 or above, representing nearly 70% of the federal workforce. The DRP is therefore not only unauthorized but likely violates multiple federal statutes.DRP payments may exceed legally available funds under the Antideficiency ActThe Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating funds before appropriations are made and from obligating or spending funds in excess of legally available amounts. Unlike the Purpose Statute, the Antideficiency Act carries personal liability—both administrative and criminal—including potential imprisonment for officials who knowingly and willfully violate its provisions.Initial concerns about the DRP suggested it violated the Antideficiency Act’s prohibition on advance obligations. The first wave of DRP agreements were entered into before appropriations were enacted for the second half of fiscal year 2025. However, OPM’s template agreement included a rescission clause giving agencies unilateral authority to cancel the contract. As a result, the agreements did not create enforceable obligations prior to appropriation and likely did not violate the Antideficiency Act’s restriction on advance obligations.The more serious issue involves the core spending restriction. The Act prohibits agencies from obligating or spending funds “exceeding an amount available in an appropriation or fund.” Both the Department of Justice and the GAO interpret this to include expenditures that exceed spending caps. However, the two institutions differ on where a cap must appear to trigger liability. The Justice Department views the Act as violated only when an agency exceeds a limit contained in an appropriations statute itself. Under this interpretation, caps found in freestanding authorizing statutes—such as the $25, 000 VSIP ceiling—are not enforceable under the Act.The GAO takes a broader view: any statutory cap, regardless of location, can trigger liability if exceeded. If DRP payments are treated as functional equivalents to VSIPs—and there is a colorable argument that they are—and if they surpass the $25, 000 ceiling, they would violate the Antideficiency Act under the GAO’s interpretation. Because the Act imposes personal liability for violations, agency officials who authorize such payments could be held individually accountable. If acting knowingly and willfully, such liability could include criminal sanctions.The DRP represents a significant challenge to federal spending law. It disregards multiple statutory constraints, misuses appropriated funds, and circumvents established limits on both administrative leave and separation incentives. The authority to direct federal spending belongs to Congress. When agencies disregard that authority to fund their own restructuring, such action is not only unauthorized but risks institutional integrity.Madeline Materna is a legal scholar currently pursuing a PhD in Political Science at Stanford University.

    "title": "OMB wants to break down barriers for CIOs, White House official says",
    "author": "Natalie Alms",
    "content": "The Trump administration wants to make sure that chief information officers aren’t “just another back office function, ” Eric Ueland — deputy director for management at the Office of Management and Budget — said last week at GovExec’s Government Efficiency Summit .Technology is a top priority for OMB, he said, alongside reorganization, procurement reform and Made in America policies.“OMB is going to break down barriers, ensure integration and drive for outcomes to lend value to agencies and departments and ultimately to taxpayers, ” he said. “Otherwise, CIOs will end up as just another back office function where you think you go to find a replacement charger cord.”On the sidelines of the event, he told reporters that under the direction of the federal CIO, Gregory Barbaccia, OMB is looking at how to organize CIOs and get rid of redundancies.Part of that involves setting clearer authorities within departments and across the government, he said, “so that when a department turns to the CIO, the CIO is actually able to deliver and the secretary or director knows that with confidence, this can actually get done.”“Many federal CIOs are ill-organized and ill-deployed without a common view of their value proposition and the best way for them to work inside their departments and across the federal enterprise, ” Ueland said on stage. “They barely even coordinate well with each other. They don't share common missions, best practices or even technology solutions. This has to stop.”Ueland's remarks followed moves by the Trump administration to enable the politicization of CIO roles across agencies by making more of these roles open to political appointees.A line from the Trump administration’s budget request meant to ensure that CIOs are looped into budget planning for agency technology also made it into a Republican funding bill that is currently under consideration in Congress.Tucked inside the Financial Services and General Government funding bill is a provision that “the head of each executive branch agency funded by this Act shall ensure that the [CIO] of the agency has the authority to participate in decisions regarding the budget planning process related to information technology.”The bill, which the subcommittee approved Monday, also specifies that money appropriated for technology “shall be allocated within the agency … in such a manner as specified by, or approved by, the [CIO] of the agency in consultation with the Chief Financial Officer of the agency and budget chiefs.”The 2014 Federal IT Acquisition Reform Act, or FITARA, also made clear that agency CIOs are in charge of IT investments.Congress has a long way to go to pass a budget for fiscal 2026 before its end of September deadline — the complementary Senate subcommittee hasn’t yet even put out its text — but the provision offers a hint at what the White House and Republicans on Capitol Hill are envisioning for CIOs.As for what the White House wants CIOs to actually do, the Trump administration is focused on modernizing antiquated systems and deploying artificial intelligence, Ueland said. Within those priorities, officials want to modernize the government’s HR landscape, made up of “a “fragmented network of HR systems” that cost $2 billion annually, he added.Another priority is artificial intelligence, Ueland said. New AI policies are expected from the Trump administration this week.Ueland also touted progress in the administration’s effort to reduce the thousands of federal websites. One thousand websites have been culled, bringing the total from 7, 000 to 6, 000.“This 15% reduction is just a first step, ” he said. “We’ll continue to consolidate websites so when Americans use the web to find what they need, it’ll be easier, simpler and much more direct.”",

    "title": "Unions, good government groups urge rejection of Trump’s OSC nominee",
    "author": "Erich Wagner",
    "content": "More than 20 federal employee unions, professional associations and good government groups on Monday urged Senate lawmakers to reject President Trump’s pick to serve as the U.S. special counsel over his lack of experience and apparent hostility toward the responsibilities of the Office of Special Counsel.The coalition, led by the Project on Government Oversight, described the 28-year-old Paul Igrassia as a “demonstrably unserious nominee” for an important and difficult oversight role—protecting whistleblowers from retaliation and federal workers from political coercion.“By law, the special counsel must be ‘an attorney who, by demonstrated ability, background, training and experience, is especially qualified to carry out the functions of the position, ’” the groups wrote. “As head of OSC, the special counsel should be someone who respects federal workers, who will treat them fairly and without bias. The special counsel must be a person who will exercise their duties in a nonpartisan manner, a person of honesty and integrity who has the necessary experience to fulfill such an important role. Paul Ingrassia is none of these.”House lawmakers issued similar warnings to their Senate colleagues last month, highlighting Ingrassia’s support for overturning the 2020 election and his close ties to white supremacist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes as well as conservative social media influencer Andrew Tate, who has been charged with rape and sex trafficking in multiple countries.The coalition warned that Ingrassia, who in a public blog post earlier this year described federal employees as “parasites” and “bugmen” who “leech off the diminishing lifeblood of the dying republic, ” would turn OSC’s mission—to protect whistleblowers, safeguard merit system principles and investigate alleged Hatch Act violations—on its head.“Any notion that Ingrassia would serve civil servants fairly is belied by his prior actions, both within and outside the federal government, ” the letter states. “Moving beyond a broad disrespect for civil servants, Ingrassia has explicitly attacked entire swaths of federal employees with whom he disagrees. According to former colleagues, during his very brief stint at the Department of Justice, Ingrassia stated that anyone who worked under former attorneys general Merrick Garland or Bill Barr is unqualified to work for the current Trump administration.”And in his own writings late last year, Ingrassia said that he does not believe in the merit system principles that he would be tasked with upholding as special counsel.“If the president finds some number of these bureaucrats wanting in their duties, he should have every right to terminate them at-will, ” Ingrassia wrote. “This is not a revolutionary development, but a return to constitutional governance consistent with the letter and spirit of the document’s original meaning. The executive power is fully vested in a president of the United States under Article II—not an unelected ‘civil service.’ The idea that civil servants are ‘apolitical’ has always been hogwash, a myth propounded by these very same people who never want to be held responsible for anything.”The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee is slated to host Ingrassia, along with five other nominees, at a confirmation hearing Thursday.House Dems warn Trump’s special counsel pick is anathema to job’s duties",

    "title": "Former federal science leaders warn Trump proposals could cripple U.S. research",
    "author": "Sean Michael Newhouse",
    "content": "Bill Nelson, a former Democratic senator from Florida and NASA administrator under President Joe Biden, began his remarks at a Capitol Hill press conference on Monday in opposition to the Trump administration’s cuts to federal science spending and staff by acknowledging an \"Emergency Exit Only” placard on the door behind the lectern.“This sign says it, ” he said. “We’re in an emergency.”In the wake of Congress passing a bill to claw back $9 billion that lawmakers previously approved for foreign assistance and public media, Nelson singled out a reported possible second recissions measure targeting $30 billion in funding at the EPA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Science Foundation and the Interior and Health and Human Services departments.“The sword of Damocles holding over everybody’s head is to what degree will there be a rescission package, ” he said.Speakers at the event, which featured a person dressed up in a space suit and was put on by the Protect Science and American Innovation campaign, swore to push back on funding reductions at federal science agencies. They argued that the Trump administration’s actions and plans would weaken U.S. competitiveness and imperil potentially lifesaving research.“There's a thought that there's going to be a lot more cuts in science, and those cuts have significant long-term consequences. But we're going to keep fighting, and Congress can change this, ” said Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., to a smattering of applause.Nelson expressed some optimism that he attributed to House and Senate appropriators rejecting the president’s request to cut NASA’s fiscal 2026 budget by 24% . The House bill to fund NASA would maintain its current level of $24.8 billion, while the Senate measure would increase it to $24.9 billion. A similar phenomenon is playing out with other science agencies.Trump requested $4.5 billion for NOAA, while House appropriators would give it $5.8 billion and senators provided $6.1 billion. Likewise, NSF would receive $9 billion under the Senate bill and $7 billion under the House measure compared with the president’s $3.9 billion request .Still, speakers at the news conference expressed concerns about cuts the Trump administration is already making to agency workforces and grants.Kelly, a former astronaut, highlighted a report from Politico that at least 2, 145 high-ranking NASA employees have accepted a separation incentive as part of Trump’s push to shrink the federal employee headcount.“I'm worried about the budget cuts and the mass layoffs at NASA, ” he said. “Trump is showing 2, 000 people — experienced scientists, engineers, managers — showing them the door at NASA.”Alondra Nelson, who was the acting director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy under Biden, referenced data from Grant Watch, a project that tracks National Institutes of Health and NSF grant terminations, that found funding for 1, 650 NSF grants and 3, 500 NIH grants has ended or been paused.“We have to say clearly what this is, and it is the systematic dismantling of the research infrastructure that has been the cornerstone of American prosperity and competitiveness — the very foundation that has supported our communities for generations, even when we didn't realize it, ” she said, noting that smartphones, weather forecasts and GPS all have origins in federal research.Kelly also emphasized that it’s not easy to restart research once it’s been canceled.“We've got these long-term investments and decades of data that could just get shut down, it evaporates, it goes to some box in a closet somewhere, somebody hits delete on the file, and it's over, ” he said. “We've dedicated millions and millions of dollars and people's entire careers, and this will end when they cut the funding to their programs.”The White House did not respond to a request for comment.Nearly 340 current and former NASA employees recently signed a letter to the Trump administration opposing cuts to the agency, writing that they would “waste public resources, compromise human safety, weaken national security and undermine the core NASA mission.”Approximately 140 EPA employees were put on leave for signing a similar letter to their agency’s leadership.Bill Nelson, who is also a former astronaut, contended that the workforce reductions at these agencies would deter employees from speaking up about problems, which he noted was a factor in the Challenger disaster .“When you go about firing people like this administration has — cutting their budgets, eliminating their laboratories — what you do and what they have created is a workplace of fear and intimidation, ” he said. “That is the antithesis to safety. Safety is absolutely essential for an organization like NASA, which puts people's lives on the line.”Trump’s science order faces scrutiny from scientists and lawmakersVirginia lawmakers demand answers on Trump’s planned ‘displacement’ of NSF",

    "author": "Nick Wakeman",
    "content": "A new memo from the Office of Management and Budget describes how the General Services Administration will take over much of the government's buying of what it calls “common goods and services.”That memo sent Friday by OMB Director Russell Vought provides the implementation plan for President Trump’s March executive order, Eliminating Waste and Saving Taxpayer Dollars by Consolidating Procurement.According to the memo, only 20% of the nearly $500 billion that GSA calls “common goods and services” flowed through the agency's vehicles.“Many, but not all, common requirements are highly suitable for consolidation, ” the memo states.GSA's priority for consolidation will focus on four requirement factors:Procurements that are less likely to be consolidated at GSA are requirements that, while similar, can still differ between different agencies and those deemed complex or mission-specific in nature. Procurements not run by GSA will still require ongoing engagement between the buying and program offices.Amendments to the Federal Acquisition Regulation are coming in the next 60 days that will require agencies to use existing contracts. Agencies are currently encouraged to do that.\"Common sense dictates that agencies should routinely use existing government-wide contracts that can meet their needs before undertaking the time and expense of creating a new contract on the open market, \" the memo states.The FAR changes also will require agencies to get approval if they do not use an existing government-wide contract.OMB outlined two primary approaches to achieve greater consolidation:The memo does not mention any existing contracts by name, such as NASA’s SEWP or the National Institutes of Health's CIO-SP vehicles. Discussions on moving these vehicles to GSA are apparently ongoing and not finalized.CIO-SP4 is mired in protests at the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. NIH's IT acquisition arm is working against a Sept. 30 deadline to complete a corrective action and address requirements of several Trump executive orders on procurement consolidation.NASA's SEWP office is still evaluating proposals and is aiming to make awards by the end of September as well.",

    "title": "New OPM head plans to cement focus on efficiency",
    "author": "Natalie Alms",
    "content": "The new, Senate-confirmed head of the Office of Personnel Management, venture capital alum Scott Kupor, says that he wants to operationalize the focus on efficiency in his agency and throughout government, but that OPM won’t be taking orders from the Department of Government Efficiency.“OPM is its own agency, ” Kupor told reporters Monday when asked about its relationship with DOGE moving forward. “To the extent that they’re helpful in the overall goals and objectives we have, then we’re happy to partner with people, but we’re going to ultimately make the decisions that we think are in the best interests of OPM.”The agency, charged with implementing personnel policy for the federal government, was one of the first landing spots for the government-slashing DOGE at the start of the Trump administration.In February, federal employees started getting emails from an OPM address asking them to send in five bullets of what they did over the last week, a practice that remains in some agencies but has been abandoned in others.“I think it’s something that we should look at and see, like, are we getting the value out of it that at least the people who put it in place thought they were, ” Kupor said.Other policies may be harder to reverse. Kupor is entering an agency where the headcount cuts DOGE became known for are anticipated to reduce the OPM workforce by a thousand people.The agency is down by 322 employees since the start of Trump 2.0, OPM says. Once voluntary separations are finalized by the end of the year, OPM will be down from 3, 110 employees when Trump took office to about 2, 000, or around one-third of the agency, according to OPM.Most of those are voluntary departures, such as those that retired early or took the administration’s voluntary departure incentive, another feature of OPM in the first days of the Trump administration. But nearly 130 feds at OPM were laid off.Kupor, who only started the job last week, said that he may have to make up for some of those losses. The agency is looking at what gaps in service exist, which need to be filled, which can be made up for with technology and what was “nice to have, ” but not essential.“I’m quite certain that we may have, you know, made some mistakes where we need to hire back some people, ” he told reporters.OPM is also aiming to cut the 1, 200 contractors it had as of the start of the year in half by the end of 2026, said Kupor.The new OPM head spent the last 15 plus years at Andreessen Horowitz, the founders of which have backed Trump. He said that he got the gig at OPM by answering a general call for those interested in administration jobs during the transition, after which he was interviewed by the likes of former operational head of DOGE and longtime Elon Musk associate, Steve Davis, who is no longer part of DOGE.Motivated by “the idea of fiscal responsibility, ” Kupor’s priorities include making OPM a leader in operational efficiency and helping — but not forcing help upon — other agencies, he said, noting that he wants to make sure other federal agencies don’t see OPM as “aggressive.”The longtime Silicon Valley alum also wants to change performance management in the government, he said, by incentivizing efficiency and cost savings.DOGE started the process, he said, and “we have to actually institutionalize those things and make operational efficiency quite frankly a first class citizen.” Kupor told reporters that he’s worked “OPM equals other people’s money” into an internal memo he’s working on.A third objective for his tenure is preparing the government workforce to lean forward on artificial intelligence, said Kupor, offering the potential for AI to summarize comments submitted on government regulations as a likely use case.“There’s very good technology people here, ” he said when asked about the government’s tech workforce. “We’re probably missing people who are, like, super conversant with very modern, AI-related stuff.”Since Trump took office again in January, many government tech teams have been hit with layoffs or even shuttered entirely as the administration has sought to shrink the size of the government’s workforce.OPM’s own technology shop is estimated to be cut down by over 200 employees, from 389 in fiscal 2025 to 170 full-time employees projected for fiscal 2026, per the agency’s budget justification . And the loss of staff and ongoing hiring freeze is putting the agency’s Postal Service Health Benefits Program at risk of failure, according to OPM’s inspector general.“We’ve got to really just rethink our entire recruiting efforts, ” Kupor said. “I want every really smart person in this country to wake up every day and say, ‘you know what, I want to go work for the government because I can work on super hard problems that are very complex.’”Senate confirms new Office of Personnel Management head in mostly party-line voteOPM urges ‘generous approach’ to approving religion-based teleworkOPM calls for quicker firings, more stringent performance standards",

    "title": "This EPA research office safeguarded Americans’ health. Trump just eliminated it",
    "author": "Zoya Teirstein",
    "content": "For more than half a century, the Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Research and Development, or ORD, has furnished the EPA with independent research on everything from ozone pollution to pesticides like glyphosate. Last week, after months of speculation and denial, the EPA officially confirmed that it is eliminating its research division and slashing thousands more employees from its payroll in the agency’s quest to cut 23 percent of its workforce. The latest moves add to the nearly 4, 000 personnel who have already resigned, retired, or been laid off, according to the agency’s calculations.The decision came directly on the heels of a Supreme Court order that greenlit the Trump administration’s efforts to downsize and restructure the federal government.With approximately 1, 115 employees — just 7 percent of the EPA’s headcount at the start of President Donald Trump’s second term — the research office has played an outsized role in helping the agency fulfill its legal mandate to use the “best available science” in its mission to protect human health and the environment. ORD science has underpinned many of the EPA’s restrictions on contaminants in air, water, and soil, and formed the basis for regulations on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, PFAS or “forever chemicals, ” in drinking water, deadly fine particulate matter in air, carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere, and chemicals and metals like asbestos and lead.“Without a research arm, it will be very difficult for EPA to issue new standards for air or water pollutants, toxic chemicals, pesticides, or other hazards, ” said Michael Gerrard, faculty director of the Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.ORD, which works with states, local governments, and tribes in addition to its federal work, has six national research programs, each one focused on a different aspect of health and the environment. Research being undertaken at those centers included studying how to safeguard water systems from terrorist attacks, understanding the impacts of extreme weather on human health, and modeling the economic benefits of reducing air pollution.The EPA said it is moving some of ORD staff into other parts of the EPA, including into its air, water, and chemical offices and a new Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions within EPA administrator Lee Zeldin’s office. The agency said the moves will save taxpayers nearly $750 million, and produce an agency that closely resembles the shrunken version of the agency that existed under President Ronald Reagan in the early 1980s. The aim, the agency said, is to “prioritize research and science more than ever before.”In an email to Grist, an agency spokesperson called media reports about the disbanding of ORD “biased” and denied that the changes will affect the quality of EPA science. “Friday’s announcement is not an elimination of science and research, ” the agency said.But former EPA employees and environmental advocates say disbanding ORD will both weaken the EPA’s research capabilities and put its scientific independence at risk of political interference.“Part of the reason why ORD is a separate office is to preserve scientific integrity, ” said Chris Frey, an associate dean at North Carolina State University who worked in the office on and off from 1992 to 2024, most recently as its Assistant Administrator under former President Joe Biden. “From a societal perspective, it’s a huge win for the public that those decisions be based on evidence and not just opinions of stakeholders to have a vested interest in an outcome.” The EPA hasn’t said how many ORD scientists will be allowed to continue working at the agency.Already, the U.S. regulatory system gives chemical companies like 3M and DuPont a large degree of influence over how the chemicals they produce are controlled, a strategy that has been known to fail . Under the Toxic Substances Control Act, or TSCA, the EPA has 90 days to assess a chemical’s risks before it hits the market.The EPA’s decision to dissolve ORD and integrate a portion of its scientists into the agency’s policymaking infrastructure stands to benefit chemical companies and industrial polluters by rubbing away the boundaries between science and politics, science advocates argue. Research conducted at ORD not only grounded new EPA regulations, it also provided the scientific basis for TSCA enforcement.“There’s lots of ways that ORD speaking truth about impacts of pollutants was inconvenient for regulated industry, ” said Gretchen Goldman, president of the nonprofit science advocacy organization the Union of Concerned Scientists. “They’re probably celebrating over this.”Despite recent wins, industry trade and lobby groups are pushing for even more freedom. Last week, on the same day the EPA announced it was disbanding ORD and a day after the EPA separately exempted dozens of chemical factories and power plants from Biden-era air pollution and emissions rules, the American Chemistry Council’s President and CEO Chris Jahn floated the idea of making changes to the Toxic Substances Control Act in an interview with The Washington Examiner.“EPA Administrator Zeldin, the White House, Congress are all looking at this right now, ” he said, “to potentially make some updates to TSCA to make it work more effectively for the long run.”This article originally appeared in Grist .Grist is a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future.

    "title": "Judge orders Trump administration to ‘stop violating the law!’ and publish spending details",
    "author": "Jennifer Shutt",
    "content": "A federal judge on Monday ordered the Trump administration to once again publish details about the pace at which it plans to spend money approved by Congress.U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Judge Emmet Sullivan wrote in his ruling that Congress “has sweeping authority” to require the president to post a website detailing how it doles out taxpayer dollars throughout the year.“As explained in this Memorandum Opinion, there is nothing unconstitutional about Congress requiring the Executive Branch to inform the public of how it is apportioning the public’s money, ” he wrote. “Defendants are therefore required to stop violating the law!”The ruling won’t take effect until Thursday at 10 a.m. Eastern, giving the Trump administration time to appeal and to seek the ruling be put on hold during the appeals process.Sullivan was appointed to the federal district court by President Bill Clinton but was selected for two prior judicial appointments by President Ronald Reagan and President George H. W. Bush.More than two years ago, Congress began requiring the White House budget office to publicly post apportionment information and the Biden administration took that step, though Trump officials pulled down the website in March.That decision led to two separate lawsuits, one from Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and another from the Protect Democracy Project.Apportionments are the first step the executive branch takes when spending money appropriated by Congress. The documents and their footnotes usually detail how quickly, or how slowly, departments and agencies plan to send money out the door throughout the fiscal year.The documents and the public website would have been a window into whether the Trump administration was impounding, or refusing to spend, funding that lawmakers have said it should allocate on behalf of taxpayers.An attorney for the Justice Department argued during a May hearing the Trump administration believes the provision is unconstitutional and seeks to micromanage how the executive branch spends federal funds throughout the year.The DOJ lawyer also said posting the information within two business days, as called for in the law, would require the White House budget office to divert staff from other work.Lawyers for CREW and Protect Democracy Project told the judge the White House was in clear violation of the law and that the data is valuable information that helps the organizations monitor if a president were to cease spending on programs funded by Congress.The watchdog organization attorneys noted during that hearing the Government Accountability Office is looking into dozens of instances where the administration held onto congressionally approved funding instead of spending it.They said the Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, wasn’t a helpful alternative to the website since it can take months or years for organizations to get a response to their request.Sullivan wrote in the 60-page ruling the Trump administration “complaining about the extra work” that goes along with posting the information on a public website represents “a management issue; not a constitutional one.”“Here, Congress has determined that OMB’s apportionment decisions should be publicly available so that, among other things, it and the public can see whether they are consistent with congressional appropriations, ” Sullivan wrote, adding the website aids Congress with “its undisputed oversight role.”“The Acts do not dictate how OMB should apportion funds, nor do they establish a congressional management role in the administration of apportionments, ” Sullivan wrote. “The Acts merely require that the final apportionment decisions be made publicly available to provide transparency to Congress and the public.”Sullivan rejected an argument from the Trump administration that publicly sharing details about the pace at which it’s spending taxpayer dollars was unconstitutional because it required “the disclosure of privileged information.”“There is no evidence in the record remotely supporting the notion that the apportionment documents are presidential communications or are in any way subject to the presidential communications privilege, ” Sullivan wrote. “Accordingly, the Court rejects this constitutional claim.”Cerin Lindgrensavage, counsel for Protect Democracy Project, wrote in a statement the judge’s ruling “makes clear that the executive branch cannot simply ignore appropriations laws they disagree with on policy grounds, no matter what President (Donald) Trump or OMB Director Russell Vought thinks.“Congress passed a law making sure the American public could see how their taxpayer dollars are being spent, and we will continue to hold the administration accountable for making good on that promise.”Nikhel Sus, deputy chief counsel at CREW, wrote in a separate statement that the organization applauds “the court’s thorough and well-reasoned decision, which reaffirms Congress’s constitutional authority to require public disclosure of how taxpayer dollars are spent.“Americans have a right to know how taxpayer money is being spent. Ensuring public access to this information serves as a critical check on the executive branch’s abuse and misuse of federal funds.”The White House budget office and Department of Justice did not immediately return a request for comment about the ruling or whether the administration would appeal to the Circuit Court.Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., wrote in a statement that “the law is clear as day: every president is required to show the public how they are spending taxpayer dollars, and it is past time President Trump and Russ Vought get the website they illegally ripped down back up.”Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, didn’t immediately return a request for comment.",

    "author": "Sean Michael Newhouse",
    "content": "Harvard University is the latest institution to offer a fellowship for federal employees who have been impacted by the Trump administration’s government workforce cuts.The university’s Kennedy School of Government recently announced a new fellowship that will provide full scholarships for at least 50 public servants and veterans to enroll in a one-year master’s degree program starting fall 2026.“In this moment of political division and major challenges in America, it’s never been more important to invest in the next generation of public servants, ” said Jeremy Weinstein, dean of Harvard Kennedy School, in a statement . “That’s what this fellowship is all about: helping train the current and future leaders of America, who have demonstrated throughout their lives that they are ready and willing to lead their communities and our country into the future.”Individuals with at least seven years of experience in the following areas can apply for the American Service Fellowship :No-fee applications will open in September, and fellows will be selected in spring 2026. Harvard said that the spots would be split evenly between those with public service and military backgrounds.The Kennedy School has previously offered career development resources and coaching to alumni affected by the federal layoffs.Georgetown University also recently launched a fellowship program for former federal employees who are in tech specialties. Georgetown and George Washington University are both providing discounts on master’s degree programs for recently separated government workers.Democracy Forward, a legal and public policy nonprofit that has spearheaded several lawsuits against the Trump administration, this month also launched a fellowship for former federal employees and political appointees. The Civil Service Defense and Innovation Fellowship Program will support research and analysis into the extent and ramifications of Trump’s cuts to agency workforces and chart a path to restore government capabilities.“Amid a growing threat to the integrity and capacity of our federal government, this fellowship program will help ensure that those who’ve spent their careers serving the public are heard, ” said Rob Shriver, managing director of Democracy Forward’s Civil Service Strong initiative and former acting Office of Personnel Management director under President Joe Biden, in a statement . “Through this fellowship, experienced public servants will help us tell the real story of what happens when government is dismantled, and the urgency of rebuilding it so it can deliver for the American people.”The fellowship, which is remote and runs for a year starting in September 2025, provides a $100, 000 stipend for selected individuals to examine how agency workforce reductions under Trump are impacting specific policy areas. Fellows will be selected based on their expertise and experience in issues like energy and environment, health care and public health as well as national security and international affairs.The deadline to apply is Friday.Several organizations have put out resources for federal employees to find new jobs and learn new skills .Georgetown leverages ex-fed tech experts with new fellowship programEx-feds launch websites to help unemployed civil servants find new jobs",

    "author": "Natalie Alms",
    "content": "The General Services Administration’s acting director Stephen Ehikian is out of his job as head of the agency.The agency’s new acting administrator, Michael Rigas, sent an email to staff Monday morning notifying them that he had taken over as acting head of GSA and that Ehikian will stay on as the agency’s deputy director.Rigas is coming to the agency from the State Department, where he led reorganization efforts as its Senate-confirmed deputy secretary for management and resources. As part of that reorganization, State laid off 1, 350 employees .“Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources will continue to serve the American people at the State Department while also serving as GSA's Acting Administrator, \" a senior State Department official said in a statement.GSA may not be the most well-known agency, but it has been key to Trump 2.0’s agenda, given its central role in government procurement and technology, and as the manager of government real estate.It’s also been a focus for the administration’s Department of Government Efficiency. Billionaire Elon Musk, who has since backed away from the effort amid a schism with Trump, visited GSA just days into the new administration in January and had several longtime associates installed in the agency.Still, GSA hasn’t been spared from the workforce slashing efforts of the administration. Thousands have left voluntarily and others working on GSA tech, building and finance teams have been laid off.Within the agency, some are speculating that the move is part of the fallout over the Department of Government Efficiency, two employees told Nextgov/FCW.Last week, POLITICO reported that Steve Davis, the operational head of DOGE, stuck around even after the White House announced his departure.Ehikian is labeled in that reporting as an ally of Davis tasked with assessing the loyalty of DOGE staffers — something a senior Trump administration official denied — after some questioned Davis’ continued involvement as a non-government employee. Federal Acquisition Service Commissioner Josh Gruenbaum is also listed as one of three Davis allies that the longtime Musk associate “installed… as the new leaders of DOGE.”More than 2, 100 GSA employees have accepted deferred resignationsGSA's vision for procurement is about having 'one wallet'Still, many DOGE associates were included in an all-hands political appointee meeting held at GSA this morning and scheduled to repeat on a biweekly cadence, according to screenshots viewed by Nextgov/FCW .DOGE staffers on the invite include Alexander Simonpour, Nate Cavanaugh, Marshall Wood, Luke Farritor, Justin Fox, Jeremy Lewin, Frank Schuler, Ethan Shaotran and David Malcher.GSA’s associate administrator, Marianne Copenhaver, told Nextgov/FCW in a statement that “under Mike’s leadership, GSA will continue to deliver effective and efficient government services in real estate, acquisition, and technology.”During the first Trump administration, Rigas was the acting director of the Office of Personnel Management, acting deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget and acting federal chief information officer. He also worked as a senior advisor at GSA.“This will be his 3rd appointment at GSA, ” Copenhaver said. “We’re thrilled to have his institutional knowledge, leadership, and decades of experience in the private and public sector.”Editor's note: This article has been updated to include a statement from the State Department.",

    "title": "VA launches a departmentwide 'review of its mission' as it seeks changes to its operations",
    "author": "Eric Katz",
    "content": "While the Veterans Affairs Department has called off mass layoffs of its workforce, senior leaders are telling employees that major changes are still coming.VA plans to have cut 30, 000 employees by the end of September, down from its original plan of chopping 80, 000 workers and eliminating the need for “large-scale” reductions in force. The department is now launching a “VA-wide review of its mission” and structure, Christopher Syrek, the department’s chief of staff said in a memorandum last week, with the aim of improving operational efficiency.Syrek noted the memo formally canceled the one he sent out in March, which established the goal of 80, 000 cuts through layoffs. He said the new review will be informed by the process of preparing for RIFs, suggesting VA “gained a host of new ideas for better serving veterans” and it will continue to use its authority to reorganize. While “large-scale” RIFs are off the table, he said, “VA is not done improving and continues to pursue organizational reform.”As one example of upcoming changes, Kristine Groves, head of the Veteran Health Administration’s Quality and Patient Safety office, told staff on Thursday she was working with VHA senior leadership on the agency’s restructuring. Groves told employees to expect new organizational charts by the end of last week and that the resulting staffing make ups would be released in the coming days.One theme emerging from those conversations, she said, is that VA is looking to empower medical center directors. Several employees, based on meetings and internal conversations, speculated headquarters and possibly regional staff could be a casualty of that change. VA has said only it will not conduct a “large-scale RIF, ” but employees remain concerned more targeted layoffs could still take place.One worker, a nurse who is currently serving at VA’s central office rather than in a clinical position, suggested she could be moved elsewhere. Employees without clinical backgrounds may have less job security.Steven Braverman, VHA’s chief operating officer, has told staff to expect reduced footprints in call centers, human resources, regional offices known as Veterans Integrated Service Networks, or VISNs, and the IT office, according to an employee that was part of those briefings.A small group of regional leaders are meeting this week in Nashville to discuss the current state of affairs in operations and to look for opportunities to improve efficiency, according to a VA official familiar with the plans.VA in March stood up a Reorganization Implementation Cell made up of senior leaders such as those meeting in Nashville to draft RIF plans and determine the future structure of the department. Those involved in the RIC meetings were forced to sign non-disclosure agreements . One official that participated in the RIC said it was unclear how the new review Syrek announced last week would differ from those efforts, but they hoped it would not lead to a change in scope to existing dialogues.Groves told employees not to expect any sudden changes.“We are being told that this will be a thoughtful journey and will take time to make the changes, ” she said.VA backs down on mass layoffs, will cut 30K through attrition onlyVA forces staff in workforce reduction discussions to sign non-disclosure agreements",

    "title": "Census has long struggled with staffing shortages. Employees say Trump is making it worse",
    "author": "Sean Michael Newhouse",
    "content": "While the Census Bureau is best known for conducting the decennial count of every resident in the U.S., the agency continues to operate in years that don’t end in “0, ” performing surveys that measure things like national unemployment and crime rates.Census employees, however, say their ability to collect the necessary data is being hamstrung by President Donald Trump’s government staffing cuts that are exacerbating longstanding workforce shortages at the agency and creating extra work that is taking a toll on personnel.“Morale is lower than the snake’s belly, ” said one worker.The American Federation of Government Employees reported that Census’ workforce has lost at least 1, 300 individuals since the start of Trump’s second term, mostly through deferred resignation and early retirement .According to data from the Office of Personnel Management, the agency had about 13, 230 employees in September 2024.The Census worker said that her team is down to a quarter of its size, largely because of the freeze on federal hiring and a requirement that field representatives need four years of experience to receive a permanent appointment.“There are several steps once you get your initial hire as a field rep and you're not a full employee until you've been working for four years. So at any of those intermediate steps, [Census] interpreted it as a ‘new hire’ because you would change your status, ” said the employee, who asked not to be named out of fear of retribution. “And rather than change status, they let people go.”Field representatives are part-time and interview survey respondents. Hourly pay is generally $17 to $25, based on job postings and depending on location, and they do not immediately receive benefits like paid time off.One of the employee’s former coworkers said that he was performing a 180-day temporary assignment that he applied to renew. He was told, however, that continuing was not possible due to the hiring freeze. But after his service ended, the agency informed him that he can reapply. He’s currently waiting to hear back.“I honor the mission and the mandate of the Census Bureau to be collecting data that really has significant value. It's just kind of my own ethical concept of democracy, if you will. It’s important. I don't know if that sounds a little naive or stupid, but that's what it's about, ” he said. “It's interesting work that I am happy to do, if they want me to do it. They can't decide.”Census is currently hiring for 53 positions, according to usajobs.gov, including 18 field representatives.Because her team is understaffed, the employee said that Census has had to bring in employees from outside of the region.“Someone had to come [from two hours away] last month and get a hotel room. This is all added expense, ” she said. “We don't have enough people, so they have to spend money on housing, room and mileage.”The employee also said that she’s resistant to taking time off because of the work that could build up.“Heck, I've got 40 sick hours, but I don't dare use them because there’s nobody to take up the slack, ” she said.Staffing shortages at Census are not a new phenomenon.The inspector general for the Commerce Department, which is the parent department of the bureau, issued a report in March that the agency from fiscal years 2019 through 2023 missed field representative staffing goals for three major surveys. The watchdog faulted Census for not developing a workplan to address the gaps; although, officials then committed to crafting one.“If the bureau does not recruit and retain enough quality employees for FR positions, it will not have sufficient and capable staff to complete interviews and collect social and economic data the federal government, businesses and other groups need, ” the inspector general wrote.Likewise, the Census employee is concerned about the continued reliability of the agency’s work.“I think the bottom line is that the fewer people we have, the less real geographic coverage we have. There are just so many ramifications of not having adequate staffing…and having to pull people in from other places, ” she said. “There's a lot of ramifications for the amount of data that can be collected and the validity of that data.”Census did not respond to a request for comment, however, it did report in its fiscal 2026 budget that it plans to make “more efficient use of existing personnel resources and funding” and “streamline operations.”“By the end of fiscal 2026, the Census Bureau will have eliminated functions that are not statutorily mandated or core to the Bureau’s mission while providing high-quality, efficient delivery of statutorily required functions, ” the agency wrote. “The Census Bureau will have consolidated areas of the agency that are duplicative; consolidated management layers; and continued to implement technological solutions that automate routine tasks while enabling staff to focus on higher-value activities.”Employees swarm to second ‘deferred resignation’ offer, though some are receiving unexpected responsesOPM will grant VERA authority to all agencies, as confusion around ‘deferred resignation’ program continuesTrump extends hiring freeze for 3 more months",

    "title": "Senate spending panel axes provision moving FBI headquarters to Maryland",
    "author": "Jennifer Shutt",
    "content": "The Senate Appropriations Committee removed language from one of its annual government funding bills Thursday that would have prevented the Trump administration from relocating the FBI’s headquarters anywhere other than a previously selected location in a Maryland suburb outside Washington, D.C.The change of course came one week after the committee voted to adopt an amendment from Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., that would have blocked the FBI from moving to the Ronald Reagan Building, which sits a few blocks away from the agency’s crumbling D.C. headquarters.Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, had voted with the committee’s Democrats to approve the amendment citing security concerns, but flipped to oppose it after speaking with FBI Director Kash Patel.“I came away with a satisfaction that my questions had been answered. I still have reservations about the move. I'll be frank with you, ” Murkowski said. “But I don't believe that we should lock the FBI into the Greenbelt location, which that amendment would do.”Murkwoski said the General Services Administration, which manages federal properties and had selected the suburban Maryland location, picked the Reagan Building after finishing an initial assessment. A third party, however, has not yet completed its security review.Murkowski cautioned the Trump administration against moving quickly to relocate the FBI headquarters, saying she’s “not convinced that we've got enough information to know that ultimately the Ronald Reagan Building is going to be the best location.”Van Hollen said that he believes the committee should be “preserving decisions” that Congress has already made and raised concerns the Reagan Building hasn’t passed a security analysis.“This has been a long, bipartisan process, ” Van Hollen said. “And so when we got the request for reprogramming from the FBI, I had hoped that we would, on a bipartisan basis, say, ‘No, we're not going to accept your reprogramming request because it flies in the face of long-standing bipartisan support for this process.’”Van Hollen reminded members of the committee that the first Trump administration halted efforts to pick a location outside of Washington, D.C., and instead proposed keeping the FBI headquarters at the same site.The FBI inspector general later published a report concluding “the revised plan contained ambiguous facility security information and did not include certain other facility security information known by the FBI, which created an inadequate and unclear summary of the security posture of the proposed new facility.”Van Hollen said Thursday he isn’t convinced the Reagan Building can meet the security requirements that Congress has said must go along with a new FBI headquarters.Van Hollen also expressed frustration that he wasn't included in the meeting between some Republican senators and the FBI director, preventing him from asking about the decision to move from the prior GSA site in Maryland to the new GSA site within the Reagan Building.Had Van Hollen’s amendment remained in the annual funding bill for the departments of Commerce and Justice it likely would have stopped the legislation from moving to the floor. Instead, the committee voted 20-9 to approve the measure.Congress is supposed to complete work on the dozen appropriations bills by the start of the next fiscal year on Oct. 1, but is significantly behind schedule and will need a bipartisan stopgap spending bill to avoid a shutdown.The federal government has been debating the best location for a new FBI headquarters for well over a decade while its current office space in the J. Edgar Hoover Building continues to deteriorate.The GSA spent years deliberating between three potential locations in Maryland and Virginia before selecting Greenbelt, Maryland, in November 2023.But the Trump administration announced earlier this month it wanted to use the Reagan Building instead, saying it would save the government money.“FBI's existing headquarters at the Hoover building is a perfect example of a government building that has accumulated years of deferred maintenance, suffering from an aging water system to concrete falling off the structure, ” GSA Acting Administrator Stephen Ehikian wrote in a statement.The Reagan Building holds numerous other offices, including the Department of Commerce, Customs and Border Protection, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Children’s Museum and several private businesses.The announcement indicated the administration may relocate Customs and Border Protection.“GSA will continue to support and work with CBP and their agency partners to fulfill their mission while the transition of the FBI to the Reagan Building commences, ” the statement read.It didn’t, however, include a timeline or a price tag.FBI to move headquarters into Reagan Building, seemingly resolving decades-long fightHow Greenbelt won the FBI’s new headquartersContentious FBI headquarters plan looms over House hearing on real estate footprint",

    "title": "Trump creates 'Schedule G' to add more political appointees to agencies top ranks",
    "author": "Eric Katz",
    "content": "President Trump created another new category of federal employee on Thursday evening, issuing an executive order to expand the number of political appointees who do not require Senate confirmation and will serve in policy-making or policy-advocating roles.While presidents can already tap an uncapped number of appointees to serve in Schedule C positions, Trump noted those individuals serve in more narrow confidential or policy-determining roles. The new positions will therefore fill a gap that currently exists in federal appointments, the White House said.The order is the latest in Trump’s effort to establish a tighter grip on the executive branch and its actions. He has already created Schedule Policy/Career, formerly known as Schedule F, which is similarly defined to Schedule G but reserved for career civil servants. Agencies are in the process of determining who qualifies for conversion to Schedule Policy/Career and those employees will become easier to fire for any reason.“President Trump believes creating non-career Schedule G positions will enhance government efficiency and accountability and improve services provided to taxpayers by increasing the horsepower for agency implementation of administration policy, ” the White House said in a fact sheet accompanying the order.Appointments to Schedule G positions are expected to lapse at the end of a presidential administration. The roles are particularly aimed at the Veterans Affairs Department and will go to applicants who prove to be suitable supporters of the president’s agenda. Agencies cannot take into consideration an applicant’s political affiliation.“Schedule G employees will be hired to help faithfully implement the President’s policy agenda, ” the White House said.Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service, said Schedule G would only make an \"overly complicated system more confusing\" and the Trump administration failed to engaged with experts, who would have said the new appointment category was creating redundancies that disempower the apolitical civil service. Adding more political appointees will mean that \"effective, stable service delivery will suffer, \" he said.“This new Schedule G classification is another misguided attempt by the administration to further politicize the federal workforce, \" Stier said. \"A president already has the power to make more than 4, 000 political appointments, far more than other democracies, most of which number their political appointees in the 10s.\"The White House boasted that Schedule G’s creation is just the latest effort to deliver on Trump's \"promise to dismantle the deep state and reclaim our government from Washington corruption.”Trump tasked the Office of Personnel Management with establishing regulations to implement Schedule G. In April, OPM issued guidance that encouraged agencies to consider offering the maximum salary of $195, 200 to attract Schedule C employees. It is not immediately clear if that pay cap will apply to Schedule G appointees. OPM’s guidance also removed career human resources staff from the process of vetting Schedule C appointees, onboarding them and setting their pay.Don Moynihan, a professor at University of Michigan’s Ford School of Public Policy, said the executive order was the president’s latest effort to strip career experts of influence within federal agencies.The order “opens space at top ranks of government for Trump loyalists as policymakers, with no limit on hires, ” Moynihan said, adding it “continues [a] pattern of politicization.”This story has been updated with additional comment .",
